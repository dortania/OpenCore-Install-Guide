# General Troubleshooting

This section is for those having issues booting either OpenCore, macOS or having issues inside macOS. If you're confused as to where exactly in the macOS boot process you're stuck, reading the [macOS Boot Process](../troubleshooting/boot.md) page can help clarify things.

**And if your issue is not covered, please read the official OpenCore documentation: [Configuration.pdf](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf)**. This document goes into much more technical detail around how OpenCore works and has much more detailed info on all supported quirks.
