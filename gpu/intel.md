# Intel iGPUs

Intel iGPUs are configured through device properties that are created in the config.plist. These device properties are set based on the PCI address of the device, though this is easy to find because all Intel iGPUs are located at `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)`. You will want to create a new dictionary entry under `Config.plist->Device Properties->Add` where the name is the PCI address of the iGPU `(PciROot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)`.

The main property that needs to be set is `AAPL,ig-platform-id`. Normally, most iGPUs are recognized automatically by macOS but you may need to come back to this page and set the device id or add other properties.

If you are just setting up the config.plist for the first time, just set `AAPL,ig-platform-id` and come back here if further configuration is needed.

This section is based on WhateverGreen's [Framebuffer Patching Guide](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/blob/master/Manual/FAQ.IntelHD.en.md). If you have trouble getting the Intel iGPU set up, you will want to check it out.

::: warning

VGA is not supported on Intel iGPUs HD5x00 and older.

## Sandy Bridge

::: tip

The Sandy Bridge drivers use the property name `AAPL,snb-platform-id` instead of `AAPL,ig-platform-id`. Make sure your config.plist reflects this.

| AAPL,snb-platform-id | Type | Comment |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| **`00000100`** | Laptop | To be used with laptops |
| **`10000300`** | NUC | To be used with Intel NUCs |
| **`10000300`** | Desktop | |

::: details Laptop Displays with resolution 1600x900+

For laptop displays that have a resolution of 1600x900 or greater, it is necessary to add an extra entry which will let macOS know that we are using a DualLink display.

::: tip Sandy/Ivy Bridge Hybrids

Some laptops from this era came with a mixed chipset setup, using Sandy Bridge CPUs with Ivy Bridge chipsets which creates issues with macOS since it expects a certain [IMEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine) ID that it doesn't find and would get stuck at boot(As Apple's iGPU drivers require an [IMEI device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine)), to fix this we need to fake the IMEI's IDs in these models. Create a new dictionary under `Device Properties->Add` for the PCI device `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x16,0x0)`, and add the below device id.

* To know if you're affected check if your CPU is an Intel Core ix-3xxx and your chipset is Hx6x (for example a laptop with HM65 or HM67 with a Core i3-3110M) through tools like AIDA64.

::: details Additional Patches for Platform ID `04006601`

If you're using `04006601` as your ig-platform-id, you may need to add the following parameters to fix external outputs as otherwise you will only have one output. (Credit to Rehabman)

| Key | Type | Value | Explanation |

| `framebuffer-patch-enable` | Number | `1`                                                          | *enabling the semantic patches in principle* (from the WhateverGreen manual) |

| `framebuffer-pipecount`    | Number | `2`                                                          | Matching PipeCount to the one on `03006601` (3 on `04` vs 2 on `03`) |

| `framebuffer-con1-enable`  | Number | `1`                                                          | This will enable patching on *connector 1* of the driver. (Which is the second connector after con0, which is the eDP/LVDS one) |

::: details Desktop 6 Series Motherboards

When using 6 series motherboards (ie. H61, B65, Q65, P67, H67, Q67, Z68), the Intel Management Engine needs to be spoofed to a 7 series device. Create a new dictionary under `Device Properties->Add` for the PCI device `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x16,0x0)`, and add the below device id.

| Key | Type | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| device-id | Data | `3A1E0000` |

**Note**: This is not needed if you have a 7 series motherboard(ie. B75, Q75, Z75, H77, Q77, Z77)
