# Desktop Haswell and Broadwell

* Supported version: 0.6.0

## Starting Point

So making a config.plist may seem hard, its not. It just takes some time but this guide will tell you how to configure everything, you won't be left in the cold. This also means if you have issues, review your config settings to make sure they're correct. Main things to note with OpenCore:

* **All properties must be defined**, there are no default OpenCore will fall back on so **do not delete sections unless told explicitly so**. If the guide doesn't mention the option, leave it at default.
* **The Sample.plist cannot be used As-Is**, you must configure it to your system
* **DO NOT USE CONFIGURATORS**, these rarely respect OpenCore's configuration and even some like Mackie's will add Clover properties and corrupt plists!

Now with all that, a quick reminder of the tools we need

* [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree)
  * Universal plist editor
* [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)
  * For generating our SMBIOS data
* [Sample/config.plist](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
  * See previous section on how to obtain: [config.plist Setup](../config.plist/README.md)

**And read this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly. Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default.**

## ACPI

![ACPI](../images/config/config-universal/aptio-iv-acpi.png)

### Add

::: tip Info

This is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to **booting macOS** and have many uses like [USB maps](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/), [disabling unsupported GPUs](../extras/spoof.md) and such. And with our system, **its even required to boot**. Guide on making them found here: [**Getting started with ACPI**](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)

For us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided:

| Required_SSDTs | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[SSDT-PLUG](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)** | Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell and newer, see [Getting Started With ACPI Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/) for more details. |
| **[SSDT-EC](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)** | Fixes the embedded controller, see [Getting Started With ACPI Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/) for more details.) |

Note that you **should not** add your generated `DSDT.aml` here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your `config.plist` and under EFI/OC/ACPI.

For those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the [**Getting started with ACPI**](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/) **page.** Compiled SSDTs have a **.aml** extension(Assembled) and will go into the `EFI/OC/ACPI` folder and **must** be specified in your config under `ACPI -> Add` as well.

:::

### Delete

This blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.

### Patch

This section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore

### Quirks

Settings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.

## Booter

![Booter](../images/config/config-universal/aptio-iv-booter.png)

This section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with OpenRuntime, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi

### MmioWhitelist

This section is allowing spaces to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, useful when paired with `DevirtualiseMmio`

### Quirks

::: tip Info
Settings relating to boot.efi patching and firmware fixes, for us, we leave it as default
:::
::: details More in-depth Info

* **AvoidRuntimeDefrag**: YES
  * Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc
* **EnableWriteUnprotector**: YES
  * Needed to remove write protection from CR0 register.
* **SetupVirtualMap**: YES
  * Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses, not needed on Skylake and newer

## DeviceProperties

![DeviceProperties](../images/config/config.plist/haswell/DeviceProperties.png)

### Add

Sets device properties from a map.

::: tip PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)

This section is set up via WhateverGreen's [Framebuffer Patching Guide](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/blob/master/Manual/FAQ.IntelHD.en.md) and is used for setting important iGPU properties.

`AAPL,ig-platform-id` is what macOS uses to determine how the iGPU drivers interact with our system, and the two values choose between are as follows:

| AAPL,ig-platform-id | Comment |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0300220D | Used when the Desktop Haswell iGPU is used to drive a display |
| 04001204 | Used when the Desktop Haswell iGPU is only used for computing tasks and doesn't drive a display |
| 07002216 | Used when the Desktop Broadwell iGPU |

I added another portion as well that shows a `device-id` fake in case you have an HD 4400 which is unsupported in macOS.

The device-id fake is set up like so:

* `12040000` - this is the device id for HD 4600 which does have support in macOS

We also add 3 more properties, `framebuffer-patch-enable`, `framebuffer-stolenmem` and `framebuffer-fbmem`. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB and third sets the framebuffer memory to 9MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS(64MB recommended) but required when not available.

* **Note**: Headless framebuffers(where the dGPU is the display out) do not need `framebuffer-patch-enable`, `framebuffer-stolenmem` and `framebuffer-fbmem`

| Key | Type | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AAPL,ig-platform-id | Data | 0300220D |
| framebuffer-patch-enable | Data | 01000000 |
| framebuffer-stolenmem | Data | 00003001 |
| framebuffer-fbmem | Data | 00009000 |
| device-id | Data | 12040000 |

(This is an example for a desktop HD 4400 without a dGPU and no BIOS options for iGPU memory)

| Key | Type | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AAPL,ig-platform-id | Data | 07002216 |
| framebuffer-patch-enable | Data | 01000000 |
| framebuffer-stolenmem | Data | 00003001 |
| framebuffer-fbmem | Data | 00009000 |

(This is an example for a desktop Iris Pro 6200 and no BIOS options for iGPU memory)

:::

::: tip PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)

`layout-id`

* Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. [AppleALC Supported Codecs](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/wiki/Supported-codecs).
* You can delete this property outright as it's unused for us at this time

For us, we'll be using the boot-arg `alcid=xxx` instead to accomplish this. `alcid` will override all other layout-IDs present. More info on this is covered in the [Post-Install Page](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/)

:::

### Delete

Removes device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this

## Kernel

![Kernel](../images/config/config-universal/kernel.png)

### Add

Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc. A reminder that [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) users can run **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R** to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out.

* **BundlePath**
  * Name of the kext
  * ex: `Lilu.kext`
* **Enabled**
  * Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext
* **ExecutablePath**
  * Path to the actual executable is hidden within the kext, you can see what path your kext has by right-clicking and selecting `Show Package Contents`. Generally, they'll be `Contents/MacOS/Kext` but some have kexts hidden within under `Plugin` folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in.
  * ex: `Contents/MacOS/Lilu`
* **PlistPath**
  * Path to the `info.plist` hidden within the kext
  * ex: `Contents/Info.plist`

### Emulate

Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons

* **CpuidMask**: Leave this blank
* **CpuidData**: Leave this blank

### Block

Blocks certain kexts from loading. Not relevant for us.

### Patch

Patches both the kernel and kexts.

### Quirks

::: tip Info

Settings relating to the kernel, for us we'll be enabling the following:

| Quirk | Enabled | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AppleCpuPmCfgLock | YES | Not needed if `CFG-Lock` is disabled in the BIOS|
| AppleXcpmCfgLock | YES | Not needed if `CFG-Lock` is disabled in the BIOS |
| DisableIOMapper | YES | Not needed if `VT-D` is disabled in the BIOS |
| LapicKernelPanic | NO | HP Machines will require this quirk |
| PanicNoKextDump | YES | |
| PowerTimeoutKernelPanic | YES | |
| XhciPortLimit | YES | |

:::

::: details More in-depth Info

* **AppleCpuPmCfgLock**: YES
  * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be AppleIntelCPUPM. **Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk**
* **AppleXcpmCfgLock**: YES
  * Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be KernelPM. **Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk**
* **CustomSMBIOSGuid**: NO
  * Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops
* **DisableIoMapper**: YES
  * Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to `dart=0` as SIP can stay on in Catalina
* **DisableRtcChecksum**: NO
  * Prevents AppleRTC from writing to primary checksum (0x58-0x59), required for users who either receive BIOS reset or are sent into Safe mode after reboot/shutdown
* **LapicKernelPanic**: NO
  * Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is `Kernel LAPIC`
* **PanicNoKextDump**: YES
  * Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur
* **PowerTimeoutKernelPanic**: YES
  * Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio.
* **XhciPortLimit**: YES
  * This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a [USB map](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/) when possible.

The reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such

These values are based of those calculated in [OpenCore debugging](../troubleshooting/debug.md)

:::

### Security

::: tip Info

Security is pretty self-explanatory, **do not skip**. We'll be changing the following:

| Quirk | Enabled | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AllowNvramReset | YES | |
| AllowSetDefault | YES | |
| Vault | Optional | This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You will regret it if you don't set it to Optional, note that it is case-sensitive |
| ScanPolicy | 0 | |

:::

::: details More in-depth Info

* **AllowNvramReset**: YES
  * Allows for NVRAM reset both in the boot picker and when pressing `Cmd+Opt+P+R`
* **AllowSetDefault**: YES
  * Allow `CTRL+Enter` and `CTRL+Index` to set default boot device in the picker
* **AuthRestart**: NO
  * Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault 2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be considered a security risk so optional

* **BootProtect**: None
  * Allows the use of Bootstrap.efi inside EFI/OC/Bootstrap instead of BOOTx64.efi, useful for those wanting to either boot with rEFInd or avoid BOOTx64.efi overwrites from Windows. Proper use of this quirks is not be covered in this guide
* **ExposeSensitiveData**: `6`
  * Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore
* **Vault**: `Optional`
  * We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore, **you won't boot with this set to Secure**
  * This is a word, it is not optional to omit this setting. You will regret it if you don't set it to `Optional`, note that it is case-sensitive
* **ScanPolicy**: `0`
  * `0` allows you to see all drives available, please refer to [Security](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/security.html) section for further details. **Will not boot USB devices with this set to default**

:::

### Tools

Used for running OC debugging tools like the shell, ProperTree's snapshot function will add these for you.

### Entries

Used for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore.

Won't be covered here, see 8.6 of [Configuration.pdf](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf) for more info

## NVRAM

![NVRAM](../images/config/config-universal/nvram.png)

### Add

::: tip 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14

Used for OpenCore's UI scaling, default will work for us. See in-depth section for more info

:::

::: details More in-depth Info

Booter Path, mainly used for UI Scaling

* **UIScale**:
  * `01`: Standard resolution
  * `02`: HiDPI (generally required for FileVault to function correctly on smaller displays)

* **DefaultBackgroundColor**: Background color used by boot.efi
  * `00000000`: Syrah Black
  * `BFBFBF00`: Light Gray

:::

::: tip 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82

System Integrity Protection bitmask

* **General Purpose boot-args**:

| boot-args | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **-v** | This enables verbose mode, which shows all the behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting instead of the Apple logo and progress bar. It's invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc. |
| **debug=0x100** | This disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot on a kernel panic. That way you can *hopefully* glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues. |
| **keepsyms=1** | This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself. |
| **alcid=1** | Used for setting layout-id for AppleALC, see [supported codecs](https://github.com/acidanthera/applealc/wiki/supported-codecs) to figure out which layout to use for your specific system. More info on this is covered in the [Post-Install Page](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/) |

* **GPU-Specific boot-args**:

| boot-args | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **agdpmod=pikera** | Used for disabling boardID on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series), without this you'll get a black screen. **Don't use if you don't have Navi**(ie. Polaris and Vega cards shouldn't use this) |
| **nvda_drv_vrl=1** | Used for enabling Nvidia's Web Drivers on Maxwell and Pascal cards in Sierra and HighSierra |
| **-wegnoegpu** | Used for disabling all other GPUs than the integrated Intel iGPU, useful for those wanting to run newer versions of macOS where their dGPU isn't supported |

* **csr-active-config**: Settings for 'System Integrity Protection' (SIP). It is generally recommended to change this with `csrutil` via the recovery partition.

csr-active-config by default is set to `00000000` which enables System Integrity Protection. You can choose a number of different values but overall we recommend keeping this enabled for best security practices. More info can be found in our troubleshooting page: [Disabling SIP](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md#disabling-sip)

* **prev-lang:kbd**: <>
  * Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of `lang-COUNTRY:keyboard`, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(**Default in Sample config is Russian**):
  * American: `en-US:0`(`656e2d55533a30` in HEX)
  * Full list can be found in [AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Utilities/AppleKeyboardLayouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt)
  * Hint: `prev-lang:kbd` can be changed into a String so you can input `en-US:0` directly instead of converting to HEX

| Key | Type | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| prev-lang:kbd | String | en-US:0 |

:::

### Delete

::: tip Info

Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that `Add` **will not overwrite** values already present in NVRAM so values like `boot-args` should be left alone. For us, we'll be changing the following:

| Quirk | Enabled |
| :--- | :--- |
| WriteFlash | YES |

:::

::: details More in-depth Info

* **LegacyEnable**: NO
  * Allows for NVRAM to be stored on nvram.plist, needed for systems without native NVRAM

* **LegacyOverwrite**: NO
  * Permits overwriting firmware variables from nvram.plist, only needed for systems without native NVRAM

* **LegacySchema**
  * Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with LegacyEnable set to YES

* **WriteFlash**: YES
  * Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables.

:::

## PlatformInfo

![PlatformInfo](../images/config/config.plist/haswell/smbios.png)

::: tip Info

For setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) application.

For this Haswell example, we chose the iMac15,1 SMBIOS. The typical breakdown is as follows:

* Haswell with only iGPU
  * iMac14,1
    * If you plan to later run macOS 11, Big Sur, iMac14,4 will be the recommended SMBIOS
* Haswell with dGPU
  * iMac14,2
    * If you plan to later run macOS 11, Big Sur, iMac15,1 will be the recommended SMBIOS
* Haswell Refresh (Devil's Canyon)
  * iMac15,1
* Broadwell
  * iMac16,1

Run GenSMBIOS, pick option 1 for downloading MacSerial and Option 3 for selecting out SMBIOS.  This will give us an output similar to the following:

```
  #######################################################
 #               iMac15,1 SMBIOS Info                  #
#######################################################

Type:         iMac15,1
Serial:       C02M9SYJFY10
Board Serial: C02408101J9G2Y7A8
SmUUID:       7B227BEC-660D-405F-8E60-411B3E4EF055
```

The `Type` part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.

The `Serial` part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.

The `Board Serial` part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.

The `SmUUID` part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.

We set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use `11223300 0000`. After install follow the [Fixing iServices](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html) page on how to find your real MAC Address)

**Reminder that you want either an invalid serial or valid serial numbers but those not in use, you want to get a message back like: "Invalid Serial" or "Purchase Date not Validated"**

[Apple Check Coverage page](https://checkcoverage.apple.com)

**Automatic**: YES

* Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections

:::

### Generic

::: details More in-depth Info

* **SpoofVendor**: YES
  * Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case

* **AdviseWindows**: NO
  * Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the Windows drive

* **UpdateDataHub**: YES
  * Update Data Hub fields

* **UpdateNVRAM**: YES
  * Update NVRAM fields

* **UpdateSMBIOS**: YES
  * Updates SMBIOS fields

* **UpdateSMBIOSMode**: Create
  * Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk

:::

## UEFI

![UEFI](../images/config/config-universal/aptio-iv-uefi.png)

**ConnectDrivers**: YES

* Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load.

### Drivers

Add your .efi drivers here.

Only drivers present here should be:

* HfsPlus.efi
* OpenRuntime.efi

### APFS

Settings related to the APFS driver, leave everything here as default.

### Audio

Related to AudioDxe settings, for us we'll be ignoring(leave as default). This is unrelated to audio support in macOS.

* For further use of AudioDxe and the Audio section, please see the Post Install page: [Add GUI and Boot-chime](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/)

### Input

Related to boot.efi keyboard passthrough used for FileVault and Hotkey support, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks. See here for more details: [Security and FileVault](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/)

### Output

Relating to OpenCore's visual output,  leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.

### ProtocolOverrides

Mainly relevant for Virtual machines, legacy macs and FileVault users. See here for more details: [Security and FileVault](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/)

### Quirks

::: tip Info
Relating to quirks with the UEFI environment, for us we'll be changing the following:

| Quirk | Enabled | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio | YES |
| UnblockFsConnect | NO | Needed mainly by HP motherboards |

:::

::: details More in-depth Info

* **DeduplicateBootOrder**: YES
  * Request fallback of some Boot prefixed variables from `OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID` to `EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID`. Used for fixing boot options.

* **IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio**: YES
  * Fix for when MSR\_FLEX\_RATIO (0x194) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-Skylake based systems

* **RequestBootVarRouting**: YES
  * Redirects AptioMemoryFix from `EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID` to `OC\_VENDOR\_VARIABLE\_GUID`. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc.

* **UnblockFsConnect**: NO
  * Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed
  
:::

### ReservedMemory

Used for exempting certain memory regions from OSes to use, mainly relevant for Sandy Bridge iGPUs or systems with faulty memory. Use of this quirk is not covered in this guide

## Cleaning up

And now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC.
