# ACPI

ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is an open standard to discover and configure computer hardware. The [ACPI specification](https://uefi.org/specifications) defines standard tables (e.g. `DSDT`, `SSDT`, `FACS`, `DMAR`) and various methods (e.g. `_DSM`, `_PRW`) for implementation. Modern hardware needs few changes to maintain `ACPI` compatibility and some options for such changes are provided as part of OpenCore.

To compile and disassemble ACPI tables, the [iASL compiler](https://github.com/acpica/acpica) developed by [ACPICA](https://www.acpica.org) can be used. A GUI front-end to iASL compiler can be downloaded from [Acidanthera/MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL/releases).

ACPI changes apply globally (to every operating system) with the following effective order:

* `Delete` is processed
* `Quirks` are processed
* `Patch` is processed
* `Add` is processed

Applying the changes globally resolves the problems of incorrect operating system detection (consistent with the ACPI specification, not possible before the operating system boots), operating system chainloading, and difficult ACPI debugging. Hence, more attention may be required when writing changes to `_OSI`.

Applying the patches early makes it possible to write so called “proxy” patches, where the original method is patched in the original table and is implemented in the patched table.

::: tip Info

This is where you'll add SSDTs for your system, these are very important to **booting macOS** and have many uses like [USB maps](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/), [disabling unsupported GPUs](../extras/spoof.md) and such. And with our system, **it's even required to boot**. Guide on making them found here: [**Getting started with ACPI**](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)

For us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided.

Note that you **should not** add your generated `DSDT.aml` here, it is already in your firmware. So if present, remove the entry for it in your `config.plist` and under `EFI/OC/ACPI`.

For those wanting a deeper dive into dumping your DSDT, how to make these SSDTs, and compiling them, please see the [**Getting started with ACPI**](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/) **page.** Compiled SSDTs have a **.aml** extension(Assembled) and will go into the `EFI/OC/ACPI` folder and **must** be specified in your config under `ACPI -> Add` as well.

# Delete

This blocks certain ACPI tables from loading, for us we can ignore this.

# Patch

This section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. For us, our patches are handled by our SSDTs. This is a much cleaner solution as this will allow us to boot Windows and other OSes with OpenCore.

::: tip Info

* OSI rename
  * This is required when using SSDT-XOSI as we redirect all OSI calls to this SSDT, **this is not needed if you're using `SSDT-GPIO`**

| Comment | String | Change _OSI to XOSI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Enabled | Boolean | YES |
| Count | Number | 0 |
| Limit | Number | 0 |
| Find | Data | `5f4f5349` |
| Replace | Data | `584f5349` |

# Quirks

Settings relating to ACPI, leave everything here as default as we have no use for these quirks.
