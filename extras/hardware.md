# Supported hardware

* Supported version: 0.5.9

So this little section is for those who are wanting to know whether their hardware will work in macOS

## Ways to check hardware

* [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy)
* Device Manager
* Product support docs

## CPU Compatibility

* macOS Sierra+ requires a SSE4,1 capable CPU
* Pentiums and some Xeons need CPU ID spoof
* Celerons and mobile pentiums will not work
* AMD CPUs need [kernel patches](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla/tree/opencore)
* 19h AMD CPUs are unsupported(3rd gen threadripper)

## GPU Compatibility

* [See GPU Buyers Guide](https://dortania.github.io/GPU-Buyers-Guide/) for compatible GPUs.

## Motherboard Compatibility

* All AMD and Intel motherboards are supported to a certain extent
* Some Intel HEDT systems will need emulated NVRAM
* Some Z370 and Z390 boards have AWAC clocks, these are incompatible with macOS and so will need an RTC fix

## SSD Compatibility

* No eMMC storage
* Samsung's PM981 and Micron's 2200S
  * Instability and kernel panics are common
* [970 Evo Plus requires a firmware upgrade to work](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/do-the-samsung-970-evo-plus-drives-work-new-firmware-available-2b2qexm7.270757/page-14#post-1960453)

## Audio Compatibility

* See the AppleALC wiki for supported codecs: [Supported codecs
](https://github.com/acidanthera/applealc/wiki/supported-codecs)
* Ryzen MIC only works on VoodooHDA and there's no MIC support on 15/16h AMD CPUs

## Networking

See supported chipset on respective drivers:

* [IntelMausi](https://github.com/acidanthera/IntelMausi/releases)
  * Required for Intel NICs, newer chipsets are based off of I211-AT will need the [SmallTreeIntel82576 kext](https://github.com/khronokernel/SmallTree-I211-AT-patch/releases)
* [AtherosE2200Ethernet](https://github.com/Mieze/AtherosE2200Ethernet)
* [RealtekRTL8111](https://github.com/Mieze/RTL8111_driver_for_OS_X)
  * For Realtek's Gigabit Ethernet
* [LucyRTL8125Ethernet](https://github.com/Mieze/LucyRTL8125Ethernet)
  * For Realtek's 2.5Gb Ethernet

Unsupported ethernet models:

* Realtek L8200A(Only found in Asus boards)
* Intel I225-V 

For the latter, you can attempt to use IntelMausiEthernet with a device-id spoof. Example of this can be found here: [SchmockLord's Z490 build](https://github.com/SchmockLord/Hackintosh-Intel-i9-10900k-Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-D)

And see [Wireless Buyers Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/) for supported wifi cards. All built in motherboard wireless cards will not work in macOS, they must be swapped.
