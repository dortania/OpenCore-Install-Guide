# OpenCore and macOS 11: Big Sur

It's that time of year again and with it, and a new macOS beta has been dropped. Here's all the info you need to get started.

You, the end user, must understand this is beta software on unsupported machines so do not pester developers for fixes. Dortania will not be accepting issues regarding this mini-guide except for typos and/or errors.**

**This guide expects you to have a basic understanding of hackintoshing. If you are not familiar with it, we highly recommend you to wait until there is an easier and more straight-forward solution available.**

## Backstory

More a mini-explainer as to why this release is a bit more painful than average macOS releases, the main culprits are as follows:

### `AvoidRuntimeDefrag`

With macOS Big Sur, the `AvoidRuntimeDefrag` Booter quirk in OpenCore broke. Because of this, the macOS kernel will fall flat when trying to boot. Reason for this is due to `cpi_count_enabled_logical_processors` requiring the MADT (APIC) table, and so OpenCore will now copy this table and ensure the kernel can access it. Users will however need a build of OpenCore 0.6.0 with commit [`bb12f5f`](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/commit/9f59339e7eb8c213e84551df0fdbf9905cd98ca4) or newer to resolve this issue.

### Kernel Collections vs prelinkedkernel

Since 10.7, the prelinkedkernel has been the default way for real macs to boot. This contained a very minimal amount of kexts to get a mac booted. This same bundle is what OpenCore uses to inject kexts, and was hoped to last quite some time. With macOS Big Sur, a huge change happened in where Apple no longer makes it the default form of booting.

Due to the hard work of acidanthera, OpenCore gained experimental support for this new format in roughly 2 weeks, and we can now attempt to boot Big Sur on our hackintoshes without a Mac or VM - although you will likely run into some issues along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before we can jump head first into installing Big Sur, we need to go over a few things:

### A supported SMBIOS

Big Sur dropped a few Ivy Bridge and Haswell based SMBIOS from macOS, so see below that yours wasn't dropped:

* iMac14,3 and older
  * Note iMac14,4 is still supported
* MacPro5,1 and older
* MacMini6,x and older
* MacBook7,1 and older
* MacBookAir5,x and older
* MacBookPro10,x and older

If your SMBIOS was supported in Catalina and isn't included above, you're good to go!

### Supported hardware

Not much hardware has been dropped, though the few that have:

* Ivy Bridge CPUs.
  * Unofficially, many have been able to boot with ease.
* Ivy Bridge iGPUs.
  * HD 4000 and HD 2500, initial developer beta forgot to remove drivers but more than likely to be removed in later updates.
* BCM94331CD based Wifi cards.
  * See [Wireless Buyers guide](https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/) for potential cards to upgrade to.

Also note that AMD OSX has updated their patches, but they are experimental and unsupported and you will not obtain support for them.

### Up-to-date kexts, bootloader and config.plist

Ensure you've updated to the latest builds (not releases) of OpenCore and all your kexts, as to avoid any odd incompatibility issues. You can find the latest builds of kexts and OpenCore here: [Kext Repo](http://kexts.goldfish64.com/) and [Driver Repo (contains OpenCore builds too)](http://drivers.goldfish64.com/).

You will also need to ensure you have a few NVRAM variables set:

* **`NVRAM` -> `Add` -> `7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82`**:
  * `boot-args`:
    * `-lilubetaall` (Enables Lilu and plugins on beta macOS versions)
    * `vsmcgen=1` (works around VirtualSMC not properly working in Big Sur)
    * `-disablegfxfirmware` (Works around WhateverGreen failing, **iGPUs only**. Note newer builds of WhateverGreen should fix this)

See below image as an example:

### Known issues

With Big Sur, quite a bit broke. Mainly the following:

* SMCBatteryManager
  * Currently RehabMan's [ACPI Battery Manager](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-acpi-battery-driver/downloads/) is the only working kext.
* AirportBrcmFixup
  * Forcing a specific driver to load with `brcmfx-driver=` may help
  * BCM94352Z users for example may need `brcmfx-driver=2` in boot-args to resolve this, other chipsets will need other variables.

And while not an issue, SIP has now gained a new bit so to properly disable SIP you need set `csr-acive-config` to `FF0F0000`.

## Installation

With installation, you'll need a few things:

* macOS Big Sur installer
* A Mac, hack, or preexisting VM to download the installer and create install media
* Latest builds of OpenCore and kexts (see above)
* Updated config.plist with prelinkedkernel forced (see above)

To grab the Big Sur installer, download the beta profile from Apple's developer portal, then check for updates in System Preferences. If you don't have a developer account, you can use gibMacOS to download it:

1. Download gibMacOS and open `gibMacOS.command`.
2. Press `M` to change the Max OS, then enter `10.16` to switch the (update) catalog to the Big Sur one. (screenshot)
3. Press `C` to change the catalog, then select the number for the developer catalog.
4. Select the number for the Big Sur beta to start downloading it. (screenshot)
5. Once finished, open the InstallAssistant.pkg that was downloaded - it will be located in the `gibMacOS/macOS Downloads/developer/XXX-XXXXX - Install macOS Beta` folder. This package from Apple will create `Install macOS Beta.app` in your `/Applications` folder. (screenshot)
