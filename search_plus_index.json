{"./":{"url":"./","title":"OpenCore Vanilla Guide","keywords":"","body":"Introduction Last edited: January 13, 2020 GitHub Pages link with Darkmode support About OpenCore is an open-source unconventional first-in-class piece of software designed to intercept kernel loading to insert a highly advanced rootkit, designed to be an alternative to Clover. OpenCore aims to resolve the constraints and issues imposed by Clover by providing a more versatile and modular system. While OpenCore is primarily designed for Hackintosh systems, it can be used in any scenario where an emulated EFI is needed. Please remember that OpenCore is still new and currently in beta. Unless you want to be on the bleeding edge of Hackintosh development or are planning on contributing to the project, you probably don't want to migrate if you have a stable system currently. Certain aspects of OpenCore such as Vault support will not be covered in this guide. Lastly, this guide is only meant to be a starting point in your journey with OpenCore and not recommended for beginners unless absolutely necessary. For those starting, please see the r/Hackintosh Vanilla Desktop Guide. And those who have issues can visit both the r/Hackintosh subreddit and r/Hackintosh discord for more help. Advantages of OpenCore On average, OpenCore systems boot faster than those using Clover. OpenCore offers better overall security with better support for FileVault. OpenCore supports boot hotkey support via boot.efi - hold Option or ESC at startup to choose a boot device, Command+R to enter Recovery or Command+Option+P+R to reset NVRAM. OpenCore is designed with the future in mind and uses modern methods to load 3rd party kernel extensions without breaking System Integrity Protection which Clover uses BootCamp switching and boot device selection are supported by reading NVRAM variables set by Startup Disk just like a real mac. Future development for AptioMemoryFix is directly tied to OpenCore, specifically being absorbed into OpenCore itself with the FwRuntimeVariable.efi being used as an extension. UEFI and Legacy boot modes are supported. Mask patching means macOS updates very little chance of breaking AMD systems, with AMD OSX patches supporting all versions of High Sierra, Mojave and Catalina OpenCore Tips Kernel extensions are loaded in the order specified in your config file, so you must load an extension's dependencies before you load the extension itself. For example, Lilu must be loaded before WhateverGreen or VirtualSMC. ACPI patches and SSDTs are applied to all operating systems. Adjust your SSDTs with If (_OSI (\"Darwin\")) {} or use rEFind in conjunction with OpenCore. Some systems require pure UEFI mode to boot. (This setting is commonly called \"Windows 8.1/10 WHQL Mode\" by motherboard manufacturers. See also on flashing a UEFI ROM onto older GPUs) Issues can occur if NVMe devices are set up as SATA devices in the BIOS. OpenCore requires a version of macOS that supports a prelinked kernel, this means any installs of OS X 10.7 Lion or newer are supported with some later versions of OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard also having support. Recommended BIOS settings Disable: Fast Boot VT-d(can be enabled if you set DisableIoMapper to YES, AMD users will need to disable SVM in the BIOS) CSM Thunderbolt Intel SGX Intel Platform Trust CFG Lock(MSR 0xE2 write protection) If this can't be turned off in the BIOS(or even found) please consider patching it out. See Fixing CFG Lock for more info. AMD CPU users don't need to worry about. Enable: VT-x Above 4G decoding Hyper-Threading Execute Disable Bit EHCI/XHCI Hand-off OS type: Windows 8.1/10 WHQL Mode Legacy RTC Device(Relevant for Z370+) Hey why does this guide look quite similar to CorpNewt's Vanilla Guide? Well, when I made the original OpenCore guide I was quite disappointed in how the whole thing was set up. It felt clunky, confusing and quite easy to get lost in as hardware-specific changes were hard to see. So I took CorpNewt's r/Hackintosh Vanilla Desktop Guide as a base and built it up from there. Full credit to him and also seriously a great guy, definitely check him out on Github(Don't worry I've talked to Corp about all this). "},"creating-the-usb.html":{"url":"creating-the-usb.html","title":"Creating the USB","keywords":"","body":"Creating the USB Last edited: January 15, 2020 Requirements: OpenCorePkg, highly recommend running the debug version to show more info AppleSupportPkg mountEFI or some form of EFI mounting(terminal command example can be found here). ProperTree or Xcode to edit .plist files (OpenCore Configurator is another tool but is heavily outdated and the Mackie version is known for corruption. Please avoid these kinds of tools at all costs!). Cleaned NVRAM(This is seriously important as you want a clean slate when working with OpenCore, luckily with OC you can press Cmd+Option+P+R while booting to clean your NVRAM as long as you have PollAppleHotKeys set to True. Some firmware require UsbKbDxe.efi for proper keyboard functionality with this setting on). USB formatted as MacOS Journaled with GUID partition map. Knowledge of how a Hackintosh works and what files yours requires(ie: Type of network controller). You must remove Clover from your system entirely if you wish to use it as your main boot-loader. Keep a backup of your Clover based EFI. Do I need macOS to setup OpenCore and install macOS? Actually no, you can go into the release tab of all your required files and grab them that way. MaciASL is only on macOS so compiling them may be more difficult if it's not handled by SSDTTime. See the installer section below for more info. Note for legacy users If you want to use OpenCore on your system, please follow the Legacy Install section first, after you can continue following the Base folder structure section Setting up OpenCore's EFI enviroment Setting up OpenCore's EFI enviroment is simple, all you need to do is format it with GUID partition map regardless of operating system. There is no real size requirement for the USB as OpenCore's entire EFI will generally be less than 5MB. For those making a full macOS installer should read the whole page before starting as the installer section goes more into what drive size and formats are required. Next, we'll want to mount the EFI partition on the USB with mountEFI. Windows and Linux users can refer to this post You'll notice that once we open the EFI partition, it's empty. This is where the fun begins. Base folder structure To setup OpenCore’s folder structure, you’ll want to grab the EFI folder found in OpenCorePkg's releases page: Now something you'll notcie is that it comes with a bunch of files in Drivers and Tools folder, we don't want most of these: Remove from Drivers: AppleUsbKbDxe.efi Used for OpenCore picker on legacy systems running DuetPkg, not recommended and even harmful on Ivy Bridge and newer NvmExpressDxe.efi Used for Haswell and older when no NVMe driver is built into the firmware XhciDxe.efi Used for Sandy Bridge and older when no XHCI driver is built into the firmware Remove from Tools: CleanNvram.efi We'll be using OpenCore's built-in function VerifyMsrE2.efi Used for verifying MSR lock, for install we can igore A cleaned up EFI: Now you can place your necessary fimrware drivers(.efi) from AppleSupportPkg into the Drivers folder and Kexts/ACPI into their respective folders. Please note that UEFI drivers from Clover are not supported with OpenCore!(EmuVariableUEFI, AptioMemoryFix, OsxAptioFixDrv, etc). Please see the Clover firmware driver conversion for more info on supported drivers and those merged into OpenCore. Please do also note that AptioMemoryFix.efi has now been split between OpenCore itself and FwRuntimeServices.efi Here's what a populated EFI can look like: Reminder: SSDTs and custom DSDTs go in ACPI folder Kexts go in Kexts folder Firmware drivers(.efi) go in the Drivers folder See Gathering Files on the next page for more info on what you need Making the macOS Installer While you don't need a fresh install of macOS to use OpenCore, some users prefer having a fresh slate with their boot manager upgrades. Users with a mac: Format the USB as HFS+/MacOS Journaled with GUID partition map, must be 16GB for Catalina Download a copy of macOS AppStore: High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina GibMacOS: Download the full macOS installer Run BuildmacOSInstallApp then drag and drop the macOS Downloads folder Run the createinstallmedia command provided by Apple Users without a mac: Format USB as Fat32 with GUID partition map, must be 4GB minimum Disk Management in Windows Disks Utility in Linux Download the macOS BaseSystem.dmg and BaseSystem.chunklist gibMacOS macrecovery.py, alternative to gibmacos Create a folder on root of Fat32 partition called com.apple.recovery.boot and place the BaseSystem.dmg and BaseSystem.chunklist in there Note: Some users may have issues booting the USB, make sure you have an HFS driver and you can also try AvoidHighAlloc set to YES. If you continue to have issues, I recommend using Midi's /r/Hackintosh macOS Internet Install and replacing mentions of clover with OpenCore "},"ktext.html":{"url":"ktext.html","title":"Gathering files","keywords":"","body":"Gathering files Last edited: January 17, 2020 Gathering files This section is for gathering miscellaneous files for booting macOS, we do expect you to know your hardware well before starting and hopefully made a Hackintosh before as we won't be deep diving in here. What's the best way to figure out if my hardware is supported? See the supported hardware section for some better insight into what macOS requires to boot, hardware support between Clover and OpenCore are quite similar. Firmware Drivers These are the drivers used for OpenCore, for the majority of systems you only need 3 .efi drivers to get up and running: ApfsDriverLoader.efi Needed for seeing APFS volumes. VboxHfs.efi or HfsPlus.efi Needed for seeing HFS volumes. Do not mix HFS drivers FwRuntimeServices.efi Replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi, used for patching boot.efi for NVRAM fixes and better memory management. For extra functionality with OpenCore: AppleUsbKbDxe.efi Used for OpenCore picker on legacy systems running DuetPkg, not recommended and even harmful on IvyBridge and newer For a full list of compatible drivers, see 11.2 Properties in the OpenCorePkg Docs. These files will go in your Drivers folder in your EFI Kexts A kext is a kernel extension, you can think of this as a driver for macOS, these files will go into the Kexts folder in your EFI All kext listed below can be found pre-compiled in the Kext Repo. Kexts here are compiled each time there's a new commit. Must haves: VirtualSMC Emulates the SMC chip found on real macs, without this macOS will not boot Alternative is FakeSMC which can have better or worse support, most commonly used on legacy hardware. Does not support FileVault in OpenCore Lilu A kext to patch many processes, required for AppleALC and WhateverGreen and recommended for VirtualSMC VirtualSMC Plugins: SMCProcessor.kext Used for monitoring CPU temperature, doesn't work AMD CPU based systems SMCSuperIO.kext Used for monitoring fan speed, doesn't work AMD CPU based systems SMCLightSensor.kext Used for the ambient light sensor on laptops, desktops can ignore SMCBatteryManager.kext Used for measuring battery readouts on laptops, desktops can ignore Graphics: WhateverGreen Used for graphics patching, all GPUs benefit from this kext. Audio: AppleALC Used for AppleHDA patching, used for giving you onboard audio. AMD 15h/16h cannot use this and Ryzen/Threadripper systems rarely have mic support Ethernet: IntelMausiEthernet Required for Intel NICs, newer chipsets are based off of I211-AT will need the SmallTreeIntel82576 kext. AMD motherboards with intel NICs generally run I211-AT AtherosE2200Ethernet Required for Atheros and Killer NICs RealtekRTL8111 Required for Realtek NICs USB: USBInjectAll Used for injecting intel USB controllers, H370, B360, H310 and X79/X99/X299 systems will likely need XHCI-unsupported as well. Does not work on AMD CPU based systems WiFi and Bluetooth: AirportBrcmFixup Used for patching non-Apple Broadcom cards, will not work on intel, Killer, Realtek, etc BrcmPatchRAM Used for uploading firmware on broadcom bluetooth chipset, required for all non-Apple Airport cards. To be paired with BrcmFirmwareData.kext BrcmPatchRAM3 for 10.14+ (must be paired with BrcmBluetoothInjector) BrcmPatchRAM2 for 10.11-10.14 BrcmPatchRAM for 10.10 or older AMD CPU Specific kexts: NullCPUPowerManagment AMD CPUs cannot use Intel's power management so we need to nullify it. XLNCUSBFIX USB fix for AMD FX systems, no effect on Ryzen VoodooHDA Audio for FX systems and front panel Mic+Audio support for Ryzen system, do not mix with AppleALC. Audio quality is noticably worse than AppleALC on Zen CPUs Extra's: AppleMCEReporterDisabler Useful starting with Catalina to disable the AppleMCEReporter kext which will cause kernel panics on AMD CPUs and dual-socket systems: MacPro6,1 MacPro7,1 iMacPro1,1 VoodooTSCSync Needed for correcting TSC on some of Intel's HEDT and server motherboards, without this macOS may be extremly slow or even unbootable Please refer to Kexts.md for a full list of supported kexts SSDTs So you see all those SSDTs in the AcpiSamples folder and wonder whether you need any of them. Well, we'll be going over a couple to see whether you need them. Do note you'll need to compile these SSDTs yourself and please read them before compiling. Some require you to adjust them for your specific system(ie: EC0 to H_EC for SSDT-EC-USBX). These files will go in your ACPI folder in your EFI If you're unsure which you need or how to compile, the specific ones for each platform are mentioned in ACPI section for your CPU's config guide and info on making these files can be found in the Getting started with ACPI SSDT-AWAC This is the 300 series RTC patch, needed for most Z390 systems though newer BIOS revisions are starting to push this to all 300 series boards including Z370. This forces the legacy RTC clock on as macOS can't communicate with AWAC yet SSDT-RTC0 Alternative to SSDT-AWAC when there is no RTC clock to enable, this SSDT will fake it instead SSDT-EC-USBX Needed to setup USB power and such correctly and required for booting macOS Catalina. This SSDT is meant for Skylake+ systems, please use SSDT-EC for older systems. See the What's new in macOS Catalina for more info regarding Embedded controller fix. SSDT-EC Needed to setup the embedded controller correctly on pre-skylake systems and required for booting macOS Catalina. SSDT-EHCx_OFF Used for disabling phatom ports on pre-skylake systems like for Z77, Z87, Z97, X79 and X99, not need if XHCI-Handoff is enabled in the BIOS SSDT-PLUG Sets PluginType, Clover alternative would be under Acpi -> GenerateOptions -> PluginType. Do note that this SSDT is made for systems where AppleACPICPU attaches CPU0, though some ACPI tables have theirs starting at PR00 so adjust accordingly. HEDT users need to verify if the path is correct(ie: \\_PR.PR00 vs \\_SB.SCK0.PR00) SSDT-SBUS-MCHC Adds an SMBus device and fixes DeviceProperties injection via _DSM for when adding properties via an SSDT. Remember to verify that the ACPI path in the SSDT matches up with your DSDT, extremely important for X79, X99 and X299 users "},"config.plist/ivy-bridge.html":{"url":"config.plist/ivy-bridge.html","title":"Ivy Bridge","keywords":"","body":"Ivy Bridge Last edited: January 16, 2020 Starting Point You'll want to start with the sample.plist that OpenCorePkg provides you in the DOCS folder and rename it to config.plist. Next, open up your favourite XML editor like ProperTree and we can get to work. Users of ProperTree will also get the benefit of running the Snapshot function which will add all the Firmware drivers, kexts and SSDTs into your config.plist(Cmd/Crtl + R and point to your OC folder). Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default. And read this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly ACPI Add: This is where you'll add SSDT patches for your system, these are most useful for laptops and OEM desktops but also common for USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. For us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided: SSDT-EC Corrects your EC devices, needed for all Catalina users. To setup you'll need to find out the name of your PNP0C09 device in your DSDT, this being either EC0, H_EC, PGEC and ECDV. You can read more about Embedded Controller issues in Catalina here: What's new in macOS Catalina SSDT-EHCx_OFF Prefered alternative over renaming EHCI for setting up USB correctly on pre-skylake systems. This can be avoided if your BIOS supports EHCI-Handoff CPU-PM Needed for proper CPU power management, you will need to run Pike's ssdtPRGen.sh script to generate this file. For those having troubles understanding the SSDTs regarding EC can use CorpNewt's SSDTTime to properly set up your SSDT. All other SSDTs can be compiled with MaciASL, don't forget that compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder. You can compile with MaciASL by running File -> Save As -> ACPI Machine Language. For a much deeper rundown on ACPI including compiling in Windows and Linux, see the Getting started with ACPI page. Block This drops certain ACPI tabes from loading, for use we need to block both CpuPm and Cpu0Ist: CpuPm: OemTableId: 437075506d000000 TableLength: 0 TableSignature: 53534454 Enabled: YES Cpu0Ist: OemTableId: 4370753049737400 TableLength: 0 TableSignature: 53534454 Enabled: YES Patch: This section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. Most PCs do not ACPI patches, so in the majority of the cases, you need to do nothing here. For those who need DSDT patches for things like XHC controllers, use SSDTs or similar Device Property patching like what's seen with Framebuffer patching. Comment Name of patch Count How many time the patch is applied, 0 will apply to all instances Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables the patch Find The original name in ACPI Replace The new name in ACPI, the length must match original Quirk: Settings for ACPI. FadtEnableReset: NO Enable reboot and shutdown on legacy hardware, not recommended unless needed NormalizeHeaders: NO Cleanup ACPI header fields, only relevant for macOS High Sierra 10.13 RebaseRegions: NO Attempt to heuristically relocate ACPI memory regions, not needed unless custom DSDT is used. ResetHwSig: NO Needed for hardware that fails to maintain hardware signature across the reboots and cause issues with waking from hibernation ResetLogoStatus: NO Workaround for OEM Windows logo not drawing on systems with BGRT tables. Booter This section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with FwRuntimeServices, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi MmioWhitelist: This section is allowing devices to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, most users can ignore this section. Quirks: AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc DevirtualiseMmio: NO Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values DisableSingleUser: NO Disables the use of Cmd+S and -s, this is closer to the behaviour of T2 based machines DisableVariableWrite: NO Needed for systems with non-functioning NVRAM like Z390 and such DiscardHibernateMap: NO Reuse original hibernate memory map, only needed for certain legacy hardware EnableSafeModeSlide: YES Allows for slide values to be used in Safemode EnableWriteUnprotector: YES Removes write protection from CR0 register during their execution ForceExitBootServices: NO Ensures ExitBootServices calls succeeds even when MemoryMap has changed, don't use unless necessary ProtectCsmRegion: NO Needed for fixing artefacts and sleep-wake issues, AvoidRuntimeDefrag resolves this already so avoid this quirk unless necessary ProvideCustomSlide: YES If there's a conflicting slide value, this option forces macOS to use a pseudo-random value. Needed for those receiving Only N/256 slide values are usable! debug message SetupVirtualMap: YES Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses ShrinkMemoryMap: NO Needed for systems with large memory maps that don't fit, don't use unless necessary DeviceProperties Add: Sets device properties from a map. This section is set up via Headkaze's Intel Framebuffer Patching Guide and applies only one actual property to begin, which is the ig-platform-id. The way we get the proper value for this is to look at the ig-platform-id we intend to use, then swap the pairs of hex bytes. If we think of our ig-plat as 0xAABBCCDD, our swapped version would look like DDCCBBAA The two ig-platform-id's we use are as follows: 0x0166000A - this is the standard hex for the ig-plat 0A006601 when hex-swapped We also add 2 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, and the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS. PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) -> Layout-id Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs. Keep in mind that some motherboards have different device locations, you can find yours by either examining the device tree in IOReg or using gfxutil You can find your audio path with the following(Do note, not all audio controllers are called HDEF, sometimes being known as HDAS, AZAL, HDAU and such): path/to/gfxutil -f HDEF Do note that layout-id is a Data value meaning you will need to convert from Number to HEX so Layout=5 would be interpreted as and Layout=11 would be . Audio can be left for post-install. Block: Removes device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this Fun Fact: The reason the byte order is swapped is due to Endianness, specifically Little Endians that modern CPUs use for ordering bytes. The more you know! Kernel Add: Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc. A reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl+R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out. BundlePath Name of the kext ex: Lilu.kext Enabled Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext ExecutablePath Path to the actual executable hidden within the kext, you can see what path you kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that Plist only kexts do not need this filled in. ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu PlistPath Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext ex: Contents/Info.plist Emulate: Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons CpuidMask: When set to Zero, original CPU bit will be used | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 ex: CPUID 0x0306A9 would be A9 06 03 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 CpuidData: The value for the CPU spoofing FF FF FF FF | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 Swap 00 for FF if needing to swap with a longer value Block: Blocks kexts from loading. Sometimes needed for disabling Apple's trackpad driver for some laptops. Patch: Patches both the kernel and kexts (this is where you would add AMD CPU patches). Quirks: AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be AppleIntelCPUPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be KernelPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmExtraMsrs: NO Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and certain Xeons AppleXcpmForceBoost: NO Forces maximum multiplier, only recommended to enable on scientific or media calculation machines that are constantly under load. Main Xeons benifit from this CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops DisableIOMapper: YES Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina ExternalDiskIcons: YES External Icons Patch, for when internal drives are treated as external drives but can also make USB drives internal. For NVMe on Z87 and below you just add built-in property via DeviceProperties. IncreasePciBarSize: NO Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally expereince a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this LapicKernelPanic: NO Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC PanicNoKextDump: YES Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio. ThirdPartyDrives: NO Enables TRIM, not needed for NVMe but AHCI based drives may require this. Please check under system report to see if your drive supports TRIM XhciPortLimit: YES This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible. The reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such. Misc Boot: Settings for boot screen (leave as-is unless you know what you're doing) HibernateMode: None Best to avoid hibernation with Hackintoshes all together HideSelf: YES Hides the EFI partition as a boot option in OC's boot picker PollAppleHotKeys: NO Allows you to use Apple's hotkeys during boot, depending on the firmware you may need to use AppleUsbKbDxe.efi instead of OpenCore's builtin support. Do note that if you can select anything in OC's picker, disabling this option can help. Popular commands: Cmd+V: Enables verbose Cmd+Opt+P+R: Cleans NVRAM Cmd+R: Boots Recovery partition Cmd+S: Boot in Single-user mode Option/Alt: Shows boot picker when ShowPicker set to NO, an alternative is ESC key Timeout: 5 This sets how long OpenCore will wait until it automatically boots from the default selection ShowPicker: YES Shows OpenCore's UI, needed for seeing your available drives or set to NO to follow default option UsePicker: YES Uses OpenCore's default GUI, set to NO if you wish to use a different GUI Debug: Debug has special use cases, leave as-is unless you know what you're doing. DisableWatchDog: YES (Useful for when OpenCore is stalling on something while booting, can also help for early macOS boot issues) Target: 67 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore DisplayLevel: 2147483714 Shows even more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore These values are based of those calculated in OpenCore debugging Security: Security is pretty self-explanatory. AllowNvramReset: YES Allows for NVRAM reset both in the boot picker and when pressing Cmd+Opt+P+R AllowSetDefault: YES Allow CTRL+Enter and CTRL+Index to set default boot device in the picker AuthRestart: NO: Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be concidered a secuirty risk so optional ExposeSensitiveData: 6 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore RequireSignature: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore RequireVault: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore as well ScanPolicy: 0 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for furthur details Tools Used for running OC debugging tools like clearing NVRAM Name Name shown in OpenCore Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path Path to file after the Tools folder ex: Shell.efi Entries: Used for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore Name Name shown in boot picker Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path PCI route of boot drive, can be found with the OpenCoreShell and the map command ex: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1D,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/NVMe(0x1,09-63-E3-44-8B-44-1B-00)/HD(1,GPT,11F42760-7AB1-4DB5-924B-D12C52895FA9,0x28,0x64000)/\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi NVRAM Add: 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 (Booter Path, majogrity can ignore but ) UIScale: 01: Standard resolution(Clover equivalent is 0x28) 02: HiDPI (generally required for FileVault to function correctly on smaller displays, Clover equivalent is 0x2A) 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 (System Integrity Protection bitmask) boot-args: -v - this enables verbose mode, which shows all the behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting instead of the Apple logo and progress bar. It's invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc. debug=0x100 - this disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot on a kernel panic. That way you can (hopefully) glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues. keepsyms=1 - this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself. shikigva=40 - this flag is specific for Nvidia users. It enables a few Shiki settings that do the following (found here): 8 - AddExecutableWhitelist - ensures that processes in the whitelist are patched. 32 - ReplaceBoardID - replaces board-id used by AppleGVA with a different board-id(iMac14,2). Do note that this generally needed for systems running Nvidia GPUs csr-active-config: Settings for SIP, generally recommended to manually change this within Recovery partition with csrutil via the recovery partition csr-active-config is set to E7030000 which effectively disables SIP. You can choose a number of other options to enable/disable sections of SIP. Some common ones are as follows: 00000000 - SIP completely enabled 30000000 - Allow unsigned kexts and writing to protected fs locations E7030000 - SIP completely disabled nvda_drv: <> For enabling Nvidia WebDrivers, set to 31 if running a Maxwell or Pascal GPU. This is the same as setting nvda_drv=1 but instead we translate it from text to hex. AMD and Intel GPU users should leave this area blank. prev-lang:kbd: <> Needed for non-Latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommeneded to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian): American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX) Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt Block: Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left.

ResetHwSig: NO Needed for hardware that fails to maintain hardware signature across the reboots and cause issues with waking from hibernation ResetLogoStatus: NO Workaround for OEM Windows logo not drawing on systems with BGRT tables. Booter This section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with FwRuntimeServices, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi MmioWhitelist: This section is allowing devices to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, most users can ignore this section. Quirks: AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc DevirtualiseMmio: NO Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values DisableSingleUser: NO Disables the use of Cmd+S and -s, this is closer to the behaviour of T2 based machines DisableVariableWrite: NO Needed for systems with non-functioning NVRAM like Z390 and such DiscardHibernateMap: NO Reuse original hibernate memory map, only needed for certain legacy hardware EnableSafeModeSlide: YES Allows for slide values to be used in Safemode EnableWriteUnprotector: YES Removes write protection from CR0 register during their execution ForceExitBootServices: NO Ensures ExitBootServices calls succeeds even when MemoryMap has changed, don't use unless necessary ProtectCsmRegion: NO Needed for fixing artefacts and sleep-wake issues, AvoidRuntimeDefrag resolves this already so avoid this quirk unless necessary ProvideCustomSlide: YES If there's a conflicting slide value, this option forces macOS to use a pseudo-random value. Needed for those receiving Only N/256 slide values are usable! debug message SetupVirtualMap: YES Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses ShrinkMemoryMap: NO Needed for systems with large memory maps that don't fit, don't use unless necessary DeviceProperties Add: Sets device properties from a map. This section is set up via Headkaze's Intel Framebuffer Patching Guide and applies only one actual property to begin, which is the ig-platform-id. The way we get the proper value for this is to look at the ig-platform-id we intend to use, then swap the pairs of hex bytes. If we think of our ig-plat as 0xAABBCCDD, our swapped version would look like DDCCBBAA The two ig-platform-id's we use are as follows: 0x0D220003 - this is used when the iGPU is used to drive a display 0300220D when hex-swapped 0x04120004 - this is used when the iGPU is only used for computing tasks and doesn't drive a display 04001204 when hex-swapped I added another portion as well that shows a device-id fake in case you have an HD 4400 which is unsupported in macOS. For this - we follow a similar procedure as our above ig-platform-id hex swapping - but this time, we only work with the first two pairs of hex bytes. If we think of our device id as 0xAABB0000, our swapped version would look like 0xBBAA0000. We don't do anything with the last 2 pairs of hex bytes. The device-id fake is set up like so: 0x04120000 - this is the device id for HD 4600 which does have support in macOS 12040000 when hex swapped PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) -> Layout-id Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs. Keep in mind that some motherboards have different device locations, you can find yours by either examining the device tree in IOReg or using gfxutil You can find your audio path with the following(Do note, not all audio controllers are called HDEF, sometimes being known as HDAS, AZAL, HDAU and such): path/to/gfxutil -f HDEF Do note that layout-id is a Data value meaning you will need to convert from Number to HEX so Layout=5 would be interpreted as and Layout=11 would be . Audio can be left for post-install. Fun Fact: The reason the byte order is swapped is due to Endianness, specifically Little Endians that modern CPUs use for ordering bytes. The more you know! Block: Removes device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this Kernel Add: Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc. A reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl+R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out. BundlePath Name of the kext ex: Lilu.kext Enabled Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext ExecutablePath Path to the actual executable hidden within the kext, you can see what path you kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that Plist only kexts do not need this filled in. ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu PlistPath Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext ex: Contents/Info.plist Emulate: Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons CpuidMask: When set to Zero, original CPU bit will be used | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 ex: CPUID 0x0306A9 would be A9 06 03 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 CpuidData: The value for the CPU spoofing FF FF FF FF | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 Swap 00 for FF if needing to swap with a longer value Block: Blocks kexts from loading. Sometimes needed for disabling Apple's trackpad driver for some laptops. Patch: Patches both the kernel and kexts (this is where you would add AMD CPU patches). Quirks: AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be AppleIntelCPUPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be KernelPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmExtraMsrs: NO Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and certain Xeons AppleXcpmForceBoost: NO Forces maximum multiplier, only recommended to enable on scientific or media calculation machines that are constantly under load. Main Xeons benifit from this CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops DisableIOMapper: YES Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina ExternalDiskIcons: YES External Icons Patch, for when internal drives are treated as external drives but can also make USB drives internal. For NVMe on Z87 and below you just add built-in property via DeviceProperties. IncreasePciBarSize: NO Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally expereince a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this LapicKernelPanic: NO Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC PanicNoKextDump: YES Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio. ThirdPartyDrives: NO Enables TRIM, not needed for NVMe but AHCI based drives may require this. Please check under system report to see if your drive supports TRIM XhciPortLimit: YES This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible. The reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such Misc Boot: Settings for boot screen (leave as-is unless you know what you're doing) HibernateMode: None Best to avoid hibernation with Hackintoshes all together HideSelf: YES Hides the EFI partition as a boot option in OC's boot picker PollAppleHotKeys: NO Allows you to use Apple's hotkeys during boot, depending on the firmware you may need to use AppleUsbKbDxe.efi instead of OpenCore's builtin support. Do note that if you can select anything in OC's picker, disabling this option can help. Popular commands: Cmd+V: Enables verbose Cmd+Opt+P+R: Cleans NVRAM Cmd+R: Boots Recovery partition Cmd+S: Boot in Single-user mode Option/Alt: Shows boot picker when ShowPicker set to NO, an alternative is ESC key Timeout: 5 This sets how long OpenCore will wait until it automatically boots from the default selection ShowPicker: YES Shows OpenCore's UI, needed for seeing your available drives or set to NO to follow default option UsePicker: YES Uses OpenCore's default GUI, set to NO if you wish to use a different GUI Debug: Debug has special use cases, leave as-is unless you know what you're doing. DisableWatchDog: YES (Useful for when OpenCore is stalling on something while booting, can also help for early macOS boot issues) Target: 67 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore DisplayLevel: 2147483714 Shows even more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore These values are based of those calculated in OpenCore debugging Security: Security is pretty self-explanatory. AllowNvramReset: YES Allows for NVRAM reset both in the boot picker and when pressing Cmd+Opt+P+R AllowSetDefault: YES Allow CTRL+Enter and CTRL+Index to set default boot device in the picker AuthRestart: NO: Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be concidered a secuirty risk so optional ExposeSensitiveData: 6 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore RequireSignature: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore RequireVault: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore as well ScanPolicy: 0 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for furthur details Tools Used for running OC debugging tools like clearing NVRAM Name Name shown in OpenCore Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path Path to file after the Tools folder ex: Shell.efi Entries: Used for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore Name Name shown in boot picker Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path PCI route of boot drive, can be found with the OpenCoreShell and the map command ex: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1D,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/NVMe(0x1,09-63-E3-44-8B-44-1B-00)/HD(1,GPT,11F42760-7AB1-4DB5-924B-D12C52895FA9,0x28,0x64000)/\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi NVRAM Add: 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 (Booter Path, majogrity can ignore but ) UIScale: 01: Standard resolution(Clover equivalent is 0x28) 02: HiDPI (generally required for FileVault to function correctly on smaller displays, Clover equivalent is 0x2A) 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 (System Integrity Protection bitmask) boot-args: -v - this enables verbose mode, which shows all the behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting instead of the Apple logo and progress bar. It's invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc. debug=0x100 - this disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot on a kernel panic. That way you can (hopefully) glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues. keepsyms=1 - this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself. shikigva=40 - this flag is specific for Nvidia users. It enables a few Shiki settings that do the following (found here): 8 - AddExecutableWhitelist - ensures that processes in the whitelist are patched. 32 - ReplaceBoardID - replaces board-id used by AppleGVA by a different board-id. Do note that this generally needed for systems running Nvidia GPUs csr-active-config: Settings for SIP, generally recommended to manually change this within Recovery partition with csrutil via the recovery partition csr-active-config is set to E7030000 which effectively disables SIP. You can choose a number of other options to enable/disable sections of SIP. Some common ones are as follows: 00000000 - SIP completely enabled 30000000 - Allow unsigned kexts and writing to protected fs locations E7030000 - SIP completely disabled nvda_drv: <> For enabling Nvidia WebDrivers, set to 31 if running a Maxwell or Pascal GPU. This is the same as setting nvda_drv=1 but instead we translate it from text to hex. AMD and Intel GPU users should leave this area blank. prev-lang:kbd: <> Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommeneded to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian): American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX) Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt Block: Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left. LegacyEnable: NO Allows for NVRAM to be stored on nvram.plist, needed for systems without native NVRAM LegacyOverwrite: NO Permits overwriting firmware variables from nvram.plist, only needed for systems without native NVRAM LegacySchema Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with LegacyEnable set to YES WriteFlash: YES Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables. Platforminfo For setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application. For this Haswell example, we chose the iMac15,1 SMBIOS. The typical breakdown is as follows: Haswell with only iGPU iMac14,1 Haswell with dGPU iMac14,2 Haswell Refresh iMac15,1 GenSMBIOS would give us output similar to the following: ####################################################### # iMac15,1 SMBIOS Info # ####################################################### Type: iMac15,1 Serial: C02M9SYJFY10 Board Serial: C02408101J9G2Y7A8 SmUUID: 7B227BEC-660D-405F-8E60-411B3E4EF055 The Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.

This section is set up via Headkaze's Intel Framebuffer Patching Guide and applies only one actual property to begin, which is the ig-platform-id. The way we get the proper value for this is to look at the ig-platform-id we intend to use, then swap the pairs of hex bytes. If we think of our ig-plat as 0xAABBCCDD, our swapped version would look like DDCCBBAA The two ig-platform-id's we use are as follows: 0x19120000 - this is used when the iGPU is used to drive a display 00001219 when hex-swapped 0x19120001 - this is used when the iGPU is only used for computing tasks and doesn't drive a display 01001219 when hex-swapped We also add 2 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, and the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS. PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3) -> Layout-id Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs. Keep in mind that some motherboards have different device locations, you can find yours by either examining the device tree in IOReg or using gfxutil. Please note that ADR for HDAS/HDEF is 0x001F0003 and Path = PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3), PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) is generally for Haswell and earlier. You can find your audio path with the following(Do note, not all audio controllers are called HDEF, sometimes being known as HDAS, AZAL, HDAU and such): path/to/gfxutil -f HDEF Do note that layout-id is a Data value meaning you will need to convert from Number to HEX so Layout=5 would be interpreted as and Layout=11 would be . Audio can be left for post-install. Block: Removes device properties from map, for us we can ignore this Fun Fact: The reason the byte order is swapped is due to Endianness, specifically Little Endians that modern CPUs use for ordering bytes. The more you know! Kernel Add: Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc. A reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl+R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out. BundlePath Name of the kext ex: Lilu.kext Enabled Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext ExecutablePath Path to the actual executable hidden within the kext, you can see what path you kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that Plist only kexts do not need this filled in. ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu PlistPath Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext ex: Contents/Info.plist Emulate: Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons CpuidMask: When set to Zero, original CPU bit will be used | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 ex: CPUID 0x0306A9 would be A9 06 03 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 CpuidData: The value for the CPU spoofing FF FF FF FF | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 Swap 00 for FF if needing to swap with a longer value Block: Blocks kexts from loading. Sometimes needed for disabling Apple's trackpad driver for some laptops. Patch: Patches both the kernel and kexts (this is where you would add AMD CPU patches). Quirks: AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be AppleIntelCPUPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be KernelPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmExtraMsrs: NO Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and certain Xeons AppleXcpmForceBoost: NO Forces maximum multiplier, only recommended to enable on scientific or media calculation machines that are constantly under load. Main Xeons benifit from this CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops DisableIOMapper: YES Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina ExternalDiskIcons: YES External Icons Patch, for when internal drives are treated as external drives but can also make USB drives internal. For NVMe on Z87 and below you just add built-in property via DeviceProperties. IncreasePciBarSize: NO Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally expereince a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this LapicKernelPanic: NO Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC PanicNoKextDump: YES Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio. ThirdPartyDrives: NO Enables TRIM, not needed for NVMe but AHCI based drives may require this. Please check under system report to see if your drive supports TRIM XhciPortLimit: YES This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible. The reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such Misc Boot: Settings for boot screen (leave as-is unless you know what you're doing) HibernateMode: None Best to avoid hibernation with Hackintoshes all together HideSelf: YES Hides the EFI partition as a boot option in OC's boot picker PollAppleHotKeys: NO Allows you to use Apple's hotkeys during boot, depending on the firmware you may need to use AppleUsbKbDxe.efi instead of OpenCore's builtin support. Do note that if you can select anything in OC's picker, disabling this option can help. Popular commands: Cmd+V: Enables verbose Cmd+Opt+P+R: Cleans NVRAM Cmd+R: Boots Recovery partition Cmd+S: Boot in Single-user mode Option/Alt: Shows boot picker when ShowPicker set to NO, an alternative is ESC key Timeout: 5 This sets how long OpenCore will wait until it automatically boots from the default selection ShowPicker: YES Shows OpenCore's UI, needed for seeing your available drives or set to NO to follow default option UsePicker: YES Uses OpenCore's default GUI, set to NO if you wish to use a different GUI Debug: Debug has special use cases, leave as-is unless you know what you're doing. DisableWatchDog: YES (May need to be set for YES if OpenCore is stalling on something while booting, can also help for early macOS boot issues) Target: 67 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore DisplayLevel: 2147483714 Shows even more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore These values are based of those calculated in OpenCore debugging Security: Security is pretty self-explanatory. AllowNvramReset: YES Allows for NVRAM reset both in the boot picker and when pressing Cmd+Opt+P+R AllowSetDefault: YES Allow CTRL+Enter and CTRL+Index to set default boot device in the picker AuthRestart: NO: Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be concidered a secuirty risk so optional ExposeSensitiveData: 6 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore RequireSignature: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore RequireVault: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore as well ScanPolicy: 0 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for furthur details Tools Used for running OC debugging tools like clearing NVRAM Name Name shown in OpenCore Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path Path to file after the Tools folder ex: Shell.efi Entries: Used for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore Name Name shown in boot picker Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path PCI route of boot drive, can be found with the OpenCoreShell and the map command ex: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1D,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/NVMe(0x1,09-63-E3-44-8B-44-1B-00)/HD(1,GPT,11F42760-7AB1-4DB5-924B-D12C52895FA9,0x28,0x64000)/\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi NVRAM Add: 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 (Booter Path, majority can ignore but ) UIScale: 01: Standard resolution(Clover equivalent is 0x28) 02: HiDPI (generally required for FileVault to function correctly on smaller displays, Clover equivalent is 0x2A) 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 (System Integrity Protection bitmask) boot-args: -v - this enables verbose mode, which shows all the behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting instead of the Apple logo and progress bar. It's invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc. debug=0x100 - this disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot on a kernel panic. That way you can (hopefully) glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues. keepsyms=1 - this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself. shikigva=40 - this flag is specific for Nvidia users. It enables a few Shiki settings that do the following (found here): 8 - AddExecutableWhitelist - ensures that processes in the whitelist are patched. 32 - ReplaceBoardID - replaces board-id used by AppleGVA by a different board-id. Do note that this generally needed for systems running Nvidia GPUs csr-active-config: Settings for SIP, generally recommended to manually change this within Recovery partition with csrutil via the recovery partition csr-active-config is set to E7030000 which effectively disables SIP. You can choose a number of other options to enable/disable sections of SIP. Some common ones are as follows: 00000000 - SIP completely enabled 30000000 - Allow unsigned kexts and writing to protected fs locations E7030000 - SIP completely disabled nvda_drv: <> For enabling Nvidia WebDrivers, set to 31 if running a Maxwell or Pascal GPU. This is the same as setting nvda_drv=1 but instead we translate it from text to hex. AMD and Intel users should leave this area blank. prev-lang:kbd: <> Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommeneded to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian): American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX) Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt Block: Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left. LegacyEnable: NO Allows for NVRAM to be stored on nvram.plist, needed for systems without native NVRAM LegacyOverwrite: NO Permits overwriting firmware variables from nvram.plist, only needed for systems without native NVRAM LegacySchema Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with LegacyEnable set to YES WriteFlash: YES Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables. Platforminfo For setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application. For this Skylake example, we'll choose the iMac17,1 SMBIOS. GenSMBIOS would give us output similar to the following: ####################################################### # iMac17,1 SMBIOS Info # ####################################################### Type: iMac17,1 Serial: C02S3HYWGG7L Board Serial: C02629102GUGPF7AD SmUUID: 3508AD44-B67D-4AD7-A109-7955130A1033 The Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName. The Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber. The Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB. The SmUUID part gets copied toto Generic -> SystemUUID. We set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000) Reminder that you want valid serial numbers but those not in use, you want to get a message back like: \"Purchase Date not Validated\" Apple Check Coverage page Automatic: YES Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections SpoofVendor: YES Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case SupportsCsm: NO Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the windows drive UpdateDataHub: YES Update Data Hub fields UpdateNVRAM: YES Update NVRAM fields UpdateSMBIOS: YES Updates SMBIOS fields UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk UEFI ConnectDrivers: YES Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load. Drivers: Add your .efi drivers here Input: Related to boot.efi keyboard passthrough used for FileVault and Hotkey support KeyForgetThreshold: 5 The delay between each key input when holding a key down, for best results use 5 milliseconds KeyMergeThreshold: 2 The length of time that a key will be registered before resetting, for best results use 2 milliseconds KeySupport: YES Enables OpenCore's built in key support and required for boot picker selection, do not use with AppleUsbKbDxe.efi KeySupportMode: Auto Keyboard translation for OpenCore KeySwap: NO Swaps Option and Cmd key PointerSupport: NO Used for fixing broken pointer support, commonly used for Z87 Asus boards PointerSupportMode: Specifies OEM protocol, currently only supports Z87 and Z97 ASUS boards so leave blank TimerResolution: 50000 Set architecture timer resolution, Asus Z87 boards use 60000 for the interface. Settings to 0 can also work for some Protocols: (Most values can be ignored here as they're meant for real Macs/VMs) AppleSmcIo: NO Reinstalls Apple SMC I/O, this is the equivlant of VirtualSMC.efi which is only needed for users using FileVault ConsoleControl: YES Replaces Console Control protocol with a builtin version, set to YES otherwise you may see text output during booting instead of nice Apple logo. Required for most APTIO firmware FirmwareVolume: NO Fixes UI regarding Filevault, set to YES for better FileVault compatibility HashServices: NO Fixes incorrect cursor size when running FileVault, set to YES for better FileVault compatibility UnicodeCollation: NO Some older firmware have broken Unicode collation, fixes UEFI shell compatibility on these systems(generally IvyBridge and older) Quirks: AvoidHighAlloc: NO Workaround for when te motherboard can't properly access higher memory in UEFI Boot Services. Avoid unless necessary(affected models: GA-Z77P-D3 (rev. 1.1)) ExitBootServicesDelay: 0 Only required for very specific use cases like setting to 5 for ASUS Z87-Pro running FileVault2 IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio: NO Fix for when MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-skylake based systems IgnoreTextInGraphics: NO Fix for UI corruption when both text and graphics outputs happen, set to YES with SanitiseClearScreen also set to YES for pure Apple Logo(no verbose screen) ProvideConsoleGop: YES Enables GOP(Graphics output Protcol) which the macOS bootloader requires for console handle, required for seeing once the kernel takes over ReleaseUsbOwnership: NO Releases USB controller from firmware driver, needed for when your firmware doesn't support EHCI/XHCI Handoff. Clover equivalent is FixOwnership RequestBootVarFallback: YES Request fallback of some Boot prefixed variables from OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID to EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID. Used for fixing boot options. RequestBootVarRouting: YES Redirects AptioMemeoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC\\_VENDOR\\_VARIABLE\\_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc. ReplaceTabWithSpace: NO Depending on the firmware, some system may need this to properly edit files in the UEFI shell when unable to handle Tabs. This swaps it for spaces instead-but majority can ignore it but do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed SanitiseClearScreen: YES Fixes High resolutions displays that display OpenCore in 1024x768, recommended for users with 1080P+ displays ClearScreenOnModeSwitch: NO Needed for when half of the previously drawn image remains, will force black screen before switching to TextMode. Do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed UnblockFsConnect: NO Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed Cleaning up And now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC. For those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal: r/Hackintosh Subreddit r/Hackintosh Discord Post-install So what in the world needs to be done once everything is installed? Well here are some things: USB mapping Correcting audio, reread the DeviceProperties on how Enabling FileVault and other security features Fixing iMessage Moving OpenCore from the USB to your main drive Mount USB's EFI Copy EFI folder to the desktop Unmount USB and mount boot drive's EFI Paste EFI onto the root of the drive "},"config.plist/kaby-lake.html":{"url":"config.plist/kaby-lake.html","title":"Kaby Lake","keywords":"","body":"Kaby Lake Last edited: January 16, 2020 Starting Point You'll want to start with the sample.plist that OpenCorePkg provides you in the DOCS folder and rename it to config.plist. Next, open up your favourite XML editor like ProperTree and we can get to work. Users of ProperTree will also get the benefit of running the Snapshot function which will add all the Firmware drivers, kexts and SSDTs into your config.plist(Cmd/Crtl + R and point to your OC folder). Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default. And read this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly ACPI Add: This is where you'll add SSDT patches for your system, these are most useful for laptops and OEM desktops but also common for USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. For us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided: SSDT-PLUG Allows for native CPU power management, Clover alternative would be under Acpi -> GenerateOptions -> PluginType. Do note that this SSDT is made for systems where AppleACPICPU attaches CPU0, though some ACPI tables have theirs starting at PR00 so adjust accordingly. Seeing what device has AppleACPICPU connected first in IORegistryExplorer can also give you a hint SSDT-EC-USBX Corrects your EC devices, needed for all Catalina users. To setup you'll need to find out the name of your PNP0C09 device in your DSDT, this being either EC0, H_EC, PGEC and ECDV. You can read more about Embedded Controller issues in Catalina here: What's new in macOS Catalina For those having troubles understanding the SSDTs regarding plugin type and EC can use CorpNewt's SSDTTime to properly set up your SSDT. All other SSDTs can be compiled with MaciASL, don't forget that compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder. You can compile with MaciASL by running File -> Save As -> ACPI Machine Language. For a much deeper rundown on ACPI including compiling in Windows and Linux, see the Getting started with ACPI page. Block This drops certain ACPI tabes from loading, for us we can ignore this Patch: This section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. Most PCs do not ACPI patches, so in the majority of the cases, you need to do nothing here.

Platforminfo For setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application. For this Kaby Lake example, we'll chose the iMac18,1 SMBIOS - this is done intentionally for compatibility's sake. There are two main SMBIOS used for Kaby Lake: iMac18,1 - this is used for computers utilizing the iGPU for displaying. iMac18,3 - this is used for computers using a dGPU for displaying, and an iGPU for computing tasks only. GenSMBIOS would give us output similar to the following: ####################################################### # iMac18,1 SMBIOS Info # ####################################################### Type: iMac18,1 Serial: C02Z2CZ5H7JY Board Serial: C02928701GUH69FFB SmUUID: AA043F8D-33B6-4A1A-94F7-46972AAD0607 The Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.

RequestBootVarRouting: YES Redirects AptioMemeoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC\\_VENDOR\\_VARIABLE\\_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc. ReplaceTabWithSpace: NO Depending on the firmware, some system may need this to properly edit files in the UEFI shell when unable to handle Tabs. This swaps it for spaces instead-but majority can ignore it but do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed SanitiseClearScreen: YES Fixes High resolutions displays that display OpenCore in 1024x768, recommended for users with 1080P+ displays ClearScreenOnModeSwitch: NO Needed for when half of the previously drawn image remains, will force black screen before switching to TextMode. Do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed UnblockFsConnect: NO Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed Cleaning up And now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC. For those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal: r/Hackintosh Subreddit r/Hackintosh Discord Post-install So what in the world needs to be done once everything is installed? Well here are some things: USB mapping Correcting audio, reread the DeviceProperties on how Enabling FileVault and other security features Fixing iMessage Moving OpenCore from the USB to your main drive Mount USB's EFI Copy EFI folder to the desktop Unmount USB and mount boot drive's EFI Paste EFI onto the root of the drive "},"config.plist/coffee-lake.html":{"url":"config.plist/coffee-lake.html","title":"Coffee Lake","keywords":"","body":"Coffee Lake Last edited: January 14, 2020 Starting Point You'll want to start with the sample.plist that OpenCorePkg provides you in the DOCS folder and rename it to config.plist. Next, open up your favourite XML editor like ProperTree and we can get to work. Users of ProperTree will also get the benefit of running the Snapshot function which will add all the Firmware drivers, kexts and SSDTs into your config.plist(Cmd/Crtl + R and point to your OC folder). Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them, if nothing's mentioned then leave as default. And read this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly ACPI Add: This is where you'll add SSDT patches for your system, these are most useful for laptops and OEM desktops but also common for USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. For us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided: SSDT-PLUG Allows for native CPU power management, Clover alternative would be under Acpi -> GenerateOptions -> PluginType. Do note that this SSDT is made for systems where AppleACPICPU attaches CPU0, though some ACPI tables have theirs starting at PR00 so adjust accordingly. Seeing what device has AppleACPICPU connected first in IORegistryExplorer can also give you a hint SSDT-EC-USBX Corrects your EC devices, needed for all Catalina users. To setup you'll need to find out the name of your PNP0C09 device in your DSDT, this being either EC0, H_EC, PGEC and ECDV. You can read more about Embedded Controller issues in Catalina here: What's new in macOS Catalina SSDT-AWAC This is the 300 series RTC patch, required for most B360, B365, H310, H370, Z390 and some Z370 boards which prevent systems from booting macOS. The alternative is SSDT-RTC0 for when AWAC SSDT is incompatible due to missing the Legacy RTC clock, to check yourself which is needed search for AWAC and if this shows up then search for STAS in your DSDT. If nothing returns from the STAS search then you'll need the RTC0 patch For those having troubles understanding the SSDTs regarding plugin type and EC can use CorpNewt's SSDTTime to properly set up your SSDT. All other SSDTs can be compiled with MaciASL, don't forget that compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder. You can compile with MaciASL by running File -> Save As -> ACPI Machine Language. For a much deeper rundown on ACPI including compiling in Windows and Linux, see the Getting started with ACPI page. Block This drops certain ACPI tabes from loading, for us we can ignore this Patch: This section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. Most PCs do not ACPI patches, so in the majority of the cases, you need to do nothing here. For those who need DSDT patches for things like XHC controllers, use SSDTs or similar Device Property patching like what's seen with Framebuffer patching. Comment Name of patch Count How many time the patch is applied, 0 will apply to all instances Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables the patch Find The original name in ACPI Replace The new name in ACPI, the length must match original Quirk: Settings for ACPI. FadtEnableReset: NO Enable reboot and shutdown on legacy hardware, not recommended unless needed NormalizeHeaders: NO Cleanup ACPI header fields, only relevant for macOS High Sierra 10.13 RebaseRegions: NO Attempt to heuristically relocate ACPI memory regions, not needed unless custom DSDT is used. ResetHwSig: NO Needed for hardware that fails to maintain hardware signature across the reboots and cause issues with waking from hibernation ResetLogoStatus: NO Workaround for OEM Windows logo not drawing on systems with BGRT tables. Booter This section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with FwRuntimeServices, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi MmioWhitelist: This section is allowing devices to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, most users can ignore this section. Quirks: AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc DevirtualiseMmio: NO Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values DisableSingleUser: NO Disables the use of Cmd+S and -s, this is closer to the behaviour of T2 based machines DisableVariableWrite: NO Needed for systems with non-functioning NVRAM: B360, B365, H310, H370, Z390 DiscardHibernateMap: NO Reuse original hibernate memory map, only needed for certain legacy hardware EnableSafeModeSlide: YES Allows for slide values to be used in Safemode EnableWriteUnprotector: YES Removes write protection from CR0 register during their execution ForceExitBootServices: NO Ensures ExitBootServices calls succeeds even when MemoryMap has changed, don't use unless necessary ProtectCsmRegion: NO Needed for fixing artefacts and sleep-wake issues, AvoidRuntimeDefrag resolves this already so avoid this quirk unless necessary ProvideCustomSlide: YES If there's a conflicting slide value, this option forces macOS to use a pseudo-random value. Needed for those receiving Only N/256 slide values are usable! debug message SetupVirtualMap: YES Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses ShrinkMemoryMap: NO Needed for systems with large memory maps that don't fit, don't use unless necessary DeviceProperties Add: Sets device properties from a map. This section is set up via Headkaze's Intel Framebuffer Patching Guide and applies only one actual property to begin, which is the ig-platform-id. The way we get the proper value for this is to look at the ig-platform-id we intend to use, then swap the pairs of hex bytes. If we think of our ig-plat as 0xAABBCCDD, our swapped version would look like DDCCBBAA The two ig-platform-id's we use are as follows: 0x3E9B0007 - this is used when the iGPU is used to drive a display 07009B3E when hex-swapped 0x3E920003 - this is used when the iGPU is only used for computing tasks and doesn't drive a display 0300923E when hex-swapped Worth noting that for 10.12 -> 10.13.5, you would need to fake the iGPU to the same values in the Kaby Lake guide, as this was before native Coffee Lake iGPU showed up. We also add 2 more properties, framebuffer-patch-enable and framebuffer-stolenmem. The first enables patching via WhateverGreen.kext, and the second sets the min stolen memory to 19MB. This is usually unnecessary, as this can be configured in BIOS. I added another section as well that shows a fake device-id for the i3-8100's UHD 630. This has a different device id than the UHD 630 found on the 8700k, for instance, (3e918086 vs 3e928086 ). For this - we follow a similar procedure as our above ig-platform-id hex swapping - but this time, we only work with the first two pairs of hex bytes. If we think of our device id as 0xAABB0000, our swapped version would look like 0xBBAA0000. We don't do anything with the last 2 pairs of hex bytes. The device-id fake is set up like so: 0x3e920000 - this is the device id for the UHD 630 found on an 8700k 923e0000 when hex swapped Note: FakeID is only required for High Sierra, Mojave doesn't require this For users with black screen issues after verbose on B360, B365, H310, H370, Z390, please see the BusID iGPU patching page PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3) -> Layout-id Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs. Keep in mind that some motherboards have different device locations, you can find yours by either examining the device tree in IOReg or using gfxutil. Please note that ADR for HDAS/HDEF is 0x001F0003 and Path = PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3), PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) is generally for Haswell and earlier. You can find your audio path with the following(Do note, not all audio controllers are called HDEF, sometimes being known as HDAS, AZAL, HDAU and such): path/to/gfxutil -f HDEF Do note that layout-id is a Data value meaning you will need to convert from Number to HEX so Layout=5 would be interpreted as and Layout=11 would be . Audio can be left for post-install. Fun Fact: The reason the byte order is swapped is due to Endianness, specifically Little Endians that modern CPUs use for ordering bytes. The more you know! Block: Removes device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this Kernel Add: Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc. A reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl+R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out. BundlePath Name of the kext ex: Lilu.kext Enabled Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext ExecutablePath Path to the actual executable hidden within the kext, you can see what path you kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that Plist only kexts do not need this filled in. ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu PlistPath Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext ex: Contents/Info.plist Emulate: Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons CpuidMask: When set to Zero, original CPU bit will be used | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 ex: CPUID 0x0306A9 would be A9 06 03 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 CpuidData: The value for the CPU spoofing FF FF FF FF | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 Swap 00 for FF if needing to swap with a longer value Block: Blocks kexts from loading. Sometimes needed for disabling Apple's trackpad driver for some laptops. Patch: Patches both the kernel and kexts (this is where you would add AMD CPU patches). Quirks: AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be AppleIntelCPUPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be KernelPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmExtraMsrs: NO Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and certain Xeons AppleXcpmForceBoost: NO Forces maximum multiplier, only recommended to enable on scientific or media calculation machines that are constantly under load. Main Xeons benifit from this CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops DisableIOMapper: YES Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina ExternalDiskIcons: YES External Icons Patch, for when internal drives are treated as external drives but can also make USB drives internal. For NVMe on Z87 and below you just add built-in property via DeviceProperties. IncreasePciBarSize: NO Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally expereince a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this LapicKernelPanic: NO Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC PanicNoKextDump: YES Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio. ThirdPartyDrives: NO Enables TRIM, not needed for NVMe but AHCI based drives may require this. Please check under system report to see if your drive supports TRIM XhciPortLimit: YES This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible. The reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning.

Note: While iMac19,1 and iMac19,2 are a closer match, these SMBIOS are not compatible with versions of macOS older than Mojave and not all fixes are compatible with them(ie: USBInjectAll) GenSMBIOS would give us output similar to the following: ####################################################### # iMac18,1 SMBIOS Info # ####################################################### Type: iMac18,1 Serial: C02XG0FDH7JY Board Serial: C02839303QXH69FJA SmUUID: DBB364D6-44B2-4A02-B922-AB4396F16DA8 The Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName. The Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber. The Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB. The SmUUID part gets copied toto Generic -> SystemUUID. We set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000) Reminder that you want valid serial numbers but those not in use, you want to get a message back like: \"Purchase Date not Validated\" Apple Check Coverage page Automatic: YES Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections SpoofVendor: YES Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case SupportsCsm: NO Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the windows drive UpdateDataHub: YES Update Data Hub fields UpdateNVRAM: YES Update NVRAM fields UpdateSMBIOS: YES Updates SMBIOS fields UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk UEFI ConnectDrivers: YES Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load. Drivers: Add your .efi drivers here Input: Related to boot.efi keyboard passthrough used for FileVault and Hotkey support KeyForgetThreshold: 5 The delay between each key input when holding a key down, for best results use 5 milliseconds KeyMergeThreshold: 2 The length of time that a key will be registered before resetting, for best results use 2 milliseconds KeySupport: YES Enables OpenCore's built in key support and required for boot picker selection, do not use with AppleUsbKbDxe.efi KeySupportMode: Auto Keyboard translation for OpenCore KeySwap: NO Swaps Option and Cmd key PointerSupport: NO Used for fixing broken pointer support, commonly used for Z87 Asus boards PointerSupportMode: Specifies OEM protocol, currently only supports Z87 and Z97 ASUS boards so leave blank TimerResolution: 50000 Set architecture timer resolution, Asus Z87 boards use 60000 for the interface. Settings to 0 can also work for some Protocols: (Most values can be ignored here as they're meant for real Macs/VMs) AppleSmcIo: NO Reinstalls Apple SMC I/O, this is the equivlant of VirtualSMC.efi which is only needed for users using FileVault ConsoleControl: YES Replaces Console Control protocol with a builtin version, set to YES otherwise you may see text output during booting instead of nice Apple logo. Required for most APTIO firmware FirmwareVolume: NO Fixes UI regarding Filevault, set to YES for better FileVault compatibility HashServices: NO Fixes incorrect cursor size when running FileVault, set to YES for better FileVault compatibility UnicodeCollation: NO Some older firmware have broken Unicode collation, fixes UEFI shell compatibility on these systems(generally IvyBridge and older) Quirks: AvoidHighAlloc: NO Workaround for when te motherboard can't properly access higher memory in UEFI Boot Services. Avoid unless necessary(affected models: GA-Z77P-D3 (rev. 1.1)) ExitBootServicesDelay: 0 Only required for very specific use cases like setting to 5 for ASUS Z87-Pro running FileVault2 IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio: NO Fix for when MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-skylake based systems IgnoreTextInGraphics: NO Fix for UI corruption when both text and graphics outputs happen, set to YES with SanitiseClearScreen also set to YES for pure Apple Logo(no verbose screen) ProvideConsoleGop: YES Enables GOP(Graphics output Protcol) which the macOS bootloader requires for console handle, required for seeing once the kernel takes over ReleaseUsbOwnership: NO Releases USB controller from firmware driver, needed for when your firmware doesn't support EHCI/XHCI Handoff. Clover equivalent is FixOwnership RequestBootVarFallback: YES Request fallback of some Boot prefixed variables from OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID to EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID. Used for fixing boot options. RequestBootVarRouting: YES Redirects AptioMemeoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC\\_VENDOR\\_VARIABLE\\_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc. ReplaceTabWithSpace: NO Depending on the firmware, some system may need this to properly edit files in the UEFI shell when unable to handle Tabs. This swaps it for spaces instead but the majority can ignore it but do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed SanitiseClearScreen: YES Fixes High resolutions displays that display OpenCore in 1024x768, recommended for users with 1080P+ displays ClearScreenOnModeSwitch: NO Needed for when half of the previously drawn image remains, will force black screen before switching to TextMode. Do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed UnblockFsConnect: NO Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed Cleaning up And now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC. For those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal: r/Hackintosh Subreddit r/Hackintosh Discord Post-install So what in the world needs to be done once everything is installed?

Next, open up your favourite XML editor like ProperTree and we can get to work. Users of ProperTree will also get the benefit of running the Snapshot function which will add all the Firmware drivers, kexts and SSDTs into your config.plist(Cmd/Crtl + R and point to your OC folder). Do note that images will not always be the most up-to-date so please read the text below them. And read this guide more than once before setting up OpenCore and make sure you have it set up correctly ACPI Add: This is where you'll add SSDT patches for your system, these are most useful for laptops and OEM desktops but also common for USB maps, disabling unsupported GPUs and such. For us we'll need a couple of SSDTs to bring back functionality that Clover provided: SSDT-PLUG Allows for native CPU power management on Haswell-E and newer, Clover alternative would be under Acpi -> GenerateOptions -> PluginType. Do note that this SSDT is made for systems where AppleACPICPU attaches CPU0, though some ACPI tables have theirs starting at PR00 so adjust accordingly. Seeing what device has AppleACPICPU connected first in IORegistryExplorer can also give you a hint SSDT-EC-USBX Corrects your EC devices, needed for all Catalina users. To setup you'll need to find out the name of your PNP0C09 device in your DSDT, this being either EC0, H_EC, PGEC and ECDV. You can read more about Embedded Controller issues in Catalina here: What's new in macOS Catalina All SSDTs can be compiled with MaciASL, don't forget that compiled SSDTs have a .aml extension(Assembled) and will go into the EFI/OC/ACPI folder. You can compile with MaciASL by running File -> Save As -> ACPI Machine Language. For a much deeper rundown on ACPI including compiling in Windows and Linux, see the Getting started with ACPI page. Block This drops certain ACPI tabes from loading, for us we can ignore this Patch: This section allows us to dynamically modify parts of the ACPI (DSDT, SSDT, etc.) via OpenCore. Most PCs do not ACPI patches, so in the majority of the cases, you need to do nothing here. For those who need DSDT patches for things like XHC controllers, use SSDTs or similar Device Property patching like what's seen with Framebuffer patching. Comment Name of patch Count How many time the patch is applied, 0 will apply to all instances Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables the patch Find The original name in ACPI Replace The new name in ACPI, the length must match original Quirk: Settings for ACPI. FadtEnableReset: NO Enable reboot and shutdown on legacy hardware, not recommended unless needed NormalizeHeaders: NO Cleanup ACPI header fields, only relevant for macOS High Sierra 10.13 RebaseRegions: NO Attempt to heuristically relocate ACPI memory regions, not needed unless custom DSDT is used. ResetHwSig: NO Needed for hardware that fails to maintain hardware signature across the reboots and cause issues with waking from hibernation ResetLogoStatus: NO Workaround for OEM Windows logo not drawing on systems with BGRT tables. Booter This section is dedicated to quirks relating to boot.efi patching with FwRuntimeServices, the replacement for AptioMemoryFix.efi MmioWhitelist: This section is allowing devices to be passthrough to macOS that are generally ignored, most users can ignore this section. Quirks: AvoidRuntimeDefrag: YES Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, power control, etc DevirtualiseMmio: YES Reduces Stolen Memory Footprint, expands options for slide=N values and generally useful especially on HEDT and Xeon systems DisableSingleUser: NO Disables the use of Cmd+S and -s, this is closer to the behaviour of T2 based machines DisableVariableWrite: NO Needed for systems with non-functioning NVRAM, you can verify here if yours works DiscardHibernateMap: NO Reuse original hibernate memory map, only needed for certain legacy hardware EnableSafeModeSlide: YES Allows for slide values to be used in Safemode EnableWriteUnprotector: YES Removes write protection from CR0 register during their execution ForceExitBootServices: NO Ensures ExitBootServices calls succeeds even when MemoryMap has changed, don't use unless necessary ProtectCsmRegion: NO Needed for fixing artefacts and sleep-wake issues, AvoidRuntimeDefrag resolves this already so avoid this quirk unless necessary ProvideCustomSlide: YES If there's a conflicting slide value, this option forces macOS to use a pseudo-random value. Needed for those receiving Only N/256 slide values are usable! debug message SetupVirtualMap: YES Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses ShrinkMemoryMap: NO Needed for systems with large memory maps that don't fit, don't use unless necessary DeviceProperties Add: Sets device properties from a map. PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0) This section can be ignored as this is used for iGPU patching, remove PCIRoot entirely. PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3) -> Layout-id Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs. Keep in mind that some motherboards have different device locations, you can find yours by either examining the device tree in IOReg or using gfxutil. Please note that ADR for HDAS/HDEF is 0x001F0003 and Path = PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3), PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0) is generally for Haswell and earlier. You can find your audio path with the following(Do note, not all audio controllers are called HDEF, sometimes being known as HDAS and such): path/to/gfxutil -f HDEF Do note that layout-id is a Data value meaning you will need to convert from Number to HEX so Layout=5 would be interpreted as and Layout=11 would be . Audio can be left for post-install. Block: Removes device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this Fun Fact: The reason the byte order is swapped is due to Endianness, specifically Little Endians that modern CPUs use for ordering bytes. The more you know! Kernel Add: Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc. A reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl+R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out. BundlePath Name of the kext ex: Lilu.kext Enabled Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext ExecutablePath Path to the actual executable hidden within the kext, you can see what path you kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that Plist only kexts do not need this filled in. ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu PlistPath Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext ex: Contents/Info.plist Emulate: Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs, all Skylake X CPUs are natively supported Block: Blocks kexts from loading. Sometimes needed for disabling Apple's trackpad driver for some laptops. Patch: Patches both the kernel and kexts Quirks: AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be AppleIntelCPUPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be KernelPM. Please verify you can disable CFG-Lock, most systems won't boot with it on so requiring use of this quirk AppleXcpmExtraMsrs: NO Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and many Xeons. Skylake-X can ignore AppleXcpmForceBoost: NO Forces maximum multiplier, only recommended to enable on scientific or media calculation machines that are constantly under load. Main Xeons benifit from this CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops DisableIOMapper: YES Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems, much better alternative to dart=0 as SIP can stay on in Catalina ExternalDiskIcons: YES External Icons Patch, for when internal drives are treated as external drives but can also make USB drives internal. For NVMe on Z87 and below you just add built-in property via DeviceProperties. IncreasePciBarSize: NO Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally expereince a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this LapicKernelPanic: NO Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC PanicNoKextDump: YES Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio. ThirdPartyDrives: NO Enables TRIM, not needed for NVMe but AHCI based drives may require this. Please check under system report to see if your drive supports TRIM XhciPortLimit: YES This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. Please create a USB map when possible. The reason being is that UsbInjectAll reimplements builtin macOS functionality without proper current tuning. It is much cleaner to just describe your ports in a single plist-only kext, which will not waste runtime memory and such Misc Boot: Settings for boot screen (leave as-is unless you know what you're doing) HibernateMode: None Best to avoid hibernation with Hackintoshes all together HideSelf: YES Hides the EFI partition as a boot option in OC's boot picker PollAppleHotKeys: NO Allows you to use Apple's hotkeys during boot, depending on the firmware you may need to use AppleUsbKbDxe.efi instead of OpenCore's builtin support. Do note that if you can select anything in OC's picker, disabling this option can help. Popular commands: Cmd+V: Enables verbose Cmd+Opt+P+R: Cleans NVRAM Cmd+R: Boots Recovery partition Cmd+S: Boot in Single-user mode Option/Alt: Shows boot picker when ShowPicker set to NO, an alternative is ESC key Timeout: 5 This sets how long OpenCore will wait until it automatically boots from the default selection ShowPicker: YES Shows OpenCore's UI, needed for seeing your available drives or set to NO to follow default option UsePicker: YES Uses OpenCore's default GUI, set to NO if you wish to use a different GUI Debug: Debug has special use cases, leave as-is unless you know what you're doing. DisableWatchDog: YES (May need to be set for YES if OpenCore is stalling on something while booting, can also help for early macOS boot issues) Target: 67 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore DisplayLevel: 2147483714 Shows even more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore These values are based of those calculated in OpenCore debugging Security: Security is pretty self-explanatory. AllowNvramReset: YES Allows for NVRAM reset both in the boot picker and when pressing Cmd+Opt+P+R AllowSetDefault: YES Allow CTRL+Enter and CTRL+Index to set default boot device in the picker AuthRestart: NO: Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be concidered a secuirty risk so optional ExposeSensitiveData: 6 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore RequireSignature: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore RequireVault: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore as well ScanPolicy: 0 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for furthur details Tools Used for running OC debugging tools like clearing NVRAM Name Name shown in OpenCore Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path Path to file after the Tools folder ex: Shell.efi Entries: Used for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore Name Name shown in boot picker Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path PCI route of boot drive, can be found with the OpenCoreShell and the map command ex: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1D,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/NVMe(0x1,09-63-E3-44-8B-44-1B-00)/HD(1,GPT,11F42760-7AB1-4DB5-924B-D12C52895FA9,0x28,0x64000)/\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi NVRAM Add: 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 (Booter Path, majority can ignore but ) UIScale: 01: Standard resolution(Clover equivalent is 0x28) 02: HiDPI (generally required for FileVault to function correctly on smaller displays, Clover equivalent is 0x2A) 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 (System Integrity Protection bitmask) boot-args: -v - this enables verbose mode, which shows all the behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting instead of the Apple logo and progress bar. It's invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc. debug=0x100 - this disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot on a kernel panic. That way you can (hopefully) glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues. keepsyms=1 - this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself. shikigva=40 - this flag is specific for Nvidia users. It enables a few Shiki settings that do the following (found here): 8 - AddExecutableWhitelist - ensures that processes in the whitelist are patched. 32 - ReplaceBoardID - replaces board-id used by AppleGVA by a different board-id. Do note that this generally needed for systems running Nvidia GPUs csr-active-config: Settings for SIP, generally recommended to manually change this within Recovery partition with csrutil via the recovery partition csr-active-config is set to E7030000 which effectively disables SIP. You can choose a number of other options to enable/disable sections of SIP. Some common ones are as follows: 00000000 - SIP completely enabled 30000000 - Allow unsigned kexts and writing to protected fs locations E7030000 - SIP completely disabled nvda_drv: <> For enabling Nvidia WebDrivers, set to 31 if running a Maxwell or Pascal GPU. This is the same as setting nvda_drv=1 but instead we translate it from text to hex. AMD and Intel users should leave this area blank. prev-lang:kbd: <> Needed for non-latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommeneded to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian): American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX) Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt Block: Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left. LegacyEnable: NO Allows for NVRAM to be stored on nvram.plist, needed for systems without native NVRAM LegacyOverwrite: NO Permits overwriting firmware variables from nvram.plist, only needed for systems without native NVRAM LegacySchema Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with LegacyEnable set to YES WriteFlash: YES Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables. Platforminfo For setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS application. For this Skylake-X example, we'll choose the iMacPro1,1 SMBIOS. GenSMBIOS would give us output similar to the following: ####################################################### # iMacPro1,1 SMBIOS Info # ####################################################### Type: iMacPro1,1 Serial: C02YX0TZHX87 Board Serial: C029269024NJG36CB SmUUID: DEA17B2D-2F9F-4955-B266-A74C47678AD3 The Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.

DisableSingleUser: NO Disables the use of Cmd+S and -s, this is closer to the behaviour of T2 based machines DisableVariableWrite: NO Needed for systems with non-functioning NVRAM like Z390 and such DiscardHibernateMap: NO Reuse original hibernate memory map, only needed for certain legacy hardware EnableSafeModeSlide: YES Allows for slide values to be used in Safemode EnableWriteUnprotector: YES Removes write protection from CR0 register during their execution ForceExitBootServices: NO Ensures ExitBootServices calls succeeds even when MemoryMap has changed, don't use unless necessary ProtectCsmRegion: NO Needed for fixing artefacts and sleep-wake issues, AvoidRuntimeDefrag resolves this already so avoid this quirk unless necessary ProvideCustomSlide: YES If there's a conflicting slide value, this option forces macOS to use a pseudo-random value. Needed for those receiving Only N/256 slide values are usable! debug message SetupVirtualMap: YES Fixes SetVirtualAddresses calls to virtual addresses ShrinkMemoryMap: NO Needed for systems with large memory maps that don't fit, don't use unless necessary DeviceProperties Add: Sets device properties from a map. PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x4) -> layout-id Applies AppleALC audio injection, you'll need to do your own research on which codec your motherboard has and match it with AppleALC's layout. AppleALC Supported Codecs. Keep in mind that some motherboards have different device locations, you can find yours by either examining the device tree in IOReg or using gfxutil You can find your audio path with the following(Do note, not all audio controllers are called HDEF, sometimes being known as HDAS, AZAL, HDAU and such): path/to/gfxutil -f HDEF Do note that layout-id is a Data value meaning you will need to convert from Number to HEX so Layout=5 would be interpreted as and Layout=11 would be . Audio can be left for post-install. The PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0) is only for intel iGPUs, remove this section entirely. Block: Removes device properties from the map, for us we can ignore this Fun Fact: The reason the byte order is swapped is due to Endianness, specifically Little Endians that modern CPUs use for ordering bytes. The more you know! Kernel Add: Here's where you specify which kexts to load, order matters here so make sure Lilu.kext is always first! Other higher priority kexts come after Lilu such as VirtualSMC, AppleALC, WhateverGreen, etc. A reminder that ProperTree users can run Cmd/Ctrl+R to add all their kexts in the correct order without manually typing each kext out. BundlePath Name of the kext ex: Lilu.kext Enabled Self-explanatory, either enables or disables the kext ExecutablePath Path to the actual executable hidden within the kext, you can see what path you kext has by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents. Generally, they'll be Contents/MacOS/Kext but some have kexts hidden within under Plugin folder. Do note that plist only kexts do not need this filled in. ex: Contents/MacOS/Lilu PlistPath Path to the info.plist hidden within the kext ex: Contents/Info.plist Emulate: Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons(AMD CPUs don't require this) CpuidMask: When set to Zero, original CPU bit will be used | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 ex: CPUID 0x0306A9 would be A9 06 03 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 CpuidData: The value for the CPU spoofing FF FF FF FF | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 | 00 00 00 00 Swap 00 for FF if needing to swap with a longer value Block: Blocks kexts from loading. Sometimes needed for disabling Apple's trackpad driver for some laptops. Patch: This is where the AMD kernel patching magic happens. Please do note that MatchOS from Clover becomes MinKernel and MaxKernel in OpenCore, you can find pre-made patches by AlGrey(algrey#9303): Kernel patches: Ryzen/Threadripper(17h) (10.13, 10.14, and 10.15) Bulldozer/Jaguar(15h/16h) (10.13, 10.14, and 10.15) To merge: Open both files, Delete the Patch section from config.plist Copy the Patch section from patches.plist Paste into where old patches were in config.plist Quirks: AppleCpuPmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be AppleIntelCPUPM. AMD users can ignore AppleXcpmCfgLock: NO Only needed when CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS, Clover counterpart would be KernelPM. AMD users can ignore AppleXcpmExtraMsrs: NO Disables multiple MSR access needed for unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and certain Xeons AppleXcpmForceBoost: NO Forces maximum multiplier, only recommended to enable on scientific or media calculation machines that are constantly under load. Main Xeons benifit from this CustomSMBIOSGuid: NO Performs GUID patching for UpdateSMBIOSMode Custom mode. Usually relevant for Dell laptops. To be used in tandom with PlatformInfo -> UpdateSMBIOSMode -> Custom DisableIOMapper: NO Needed to get around VT-D if either unable to disable in BIOS or needed for other operating systems. Effects on AMD systems vary so recommended to disable SVM(SecureVirtualMachine) in BIOS ExternalDiskIcons: YES External Icons Patch, for when internal drives are treated as external drives but can also make USB drives internal. For NVMe on Z87 and below you just add built-in property via DeviceProperties. IncreasePciBarSize: NO Increases 32-bit PCI bar size in IOPCIFamily from 1 to 4 GB, enabling Above4GDecoding in the BIOS is a much cleaner and safer approach. Some X99 boards may require this, you'll generally expereince a kernel panic on IOPCIFamily if you need this LapicKernelPanic: NO Disables kernel panic on AP core lapic interrupt, generally needed for HP systems. Clover equivalent is Kernel LAPIC PanicNoKextDump: YES Allows for reading kernel panics logs when kernel panics occur PowerTimeoutKernelPanic: YES Helps fix kernel panics relating to power changes with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina, most notably with digital audio. ThirdPartyDrives: NO Enables TRIM, not needed for NVMe but AHCI based drives may require this. Please check under system report to see if your drive supports TRIM XhciPortLimit: YES This is actually the 15 port limit patch, don't rely on it as it's not a guaranteed solution for fixing USB. A more proper solution for AMD can be found here: AMD USB Mapping Misc Boot: Settings for boot screen (leave as-is unless you know what you're doing) HibernateMode: None Best to avoid hibernation with Hackintoshes all together HideSelf: YES Hides the EFI partition as a boot option in OC's boot picker PollAppleHotKeys: NO Allows you to use Apple's hotkeys during boot, depending on the firmware you may need to use AppleUsbKbDxe.efi instead of OpenCore's builtin support. Do note that if you can select anything in OC's picker, disabling this option can help. Popular commands: Cmd+V: Enables verbose Cmd+Opt+P+R: Cleans NVRAM Cmd+R: Boots Recovery partition Cmd+S: Boot in Single-user mode Option/Alt: Shows boot picker when ShowPicker set to NO, an alternative is ESC key Timeout: 5 This sets how long OpenCore will wait until it automatically boots from the default selection ShowPicker: YES Shows OpenCore's UI, needed for seeing your available drives or set to NO to follow default option UsePicker: YES Uses OpenCore's default GUI, set to NO if you wish to use a different GUI Debug: Debug has special use cases, leave as-is unless you know what you're doing. DisableWatchDog: YES (Useful for when OpenCore is stalling on something while booting, can also help for early macOS boot issues) Target: 67 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore DisplayLevel: 2147483714 Shows even more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore These values are based of those calculated in OpenCore debugging Security: Security is pretty self-explanatory. AllowNvramReset: YES Allows for NVRAM reset both in the boot picker and when pressing Cmd+Opt+P+R AllowSetDefault: YES Allow CTRL+Enter and CTRL+Index to set default boot device in the picker AuthRestart: NO: Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be concidered a secuirty risk so optional ExposeSensitiveData: 6 Shows more debug information, requires debug version of OpenCore RequireSignature: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore RequireVault: NO We won't be dealing vaulting so we can ignore as well ScanPolicy: 0 0 allows you to see all drives available, please refer to Security section for furthur details Tools Used for running OC debugging tools like clearing NVRAM Name Name shown in OpenCore Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path Path to file after the Tools folder ex: Shell.efi Entries: Used for specifying irregular boot paths that can't be found naturally with OpenCore Name Name shown in boot picker Enabled Self-explanatory, enables or disables Path PCI route of boot drive, can be found with the OpenCoreShell and the map command ex: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1D,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/NVMe(0x1,09-63-E3-44-8B-44-1B-00)/HD(1,GPT,11F42760-7AB1-4DB5-924B-D12C52895FA9,0x28,0x64000)/\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi NVRAM Add: 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 (Booter Path, majority can ignore but ) UIScale: 01: Standard resolution(Clover equivalent is 0x28) 02: HiDPI (generally required for FileVault to function correctly on smaller displays, Clover equivalent is 0x2A) 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 (System Integrity Protection bitmask) boot-args: -v - this enables verbose mode, which shows all the behind-the-scenes text that scrolls by as you're booting instead of the Apple logo and progress bar. It's invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc. debug=0x100 - this disables macOS's watchdog which helps prevents a reboot on a kernel panic. That way you can (hopefully) glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues. keepsyms=1 - this is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself. npci=0x2000 - this disables some PCI debugging related to kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64, alternative is npci= 0x3000 which disables debugging related to gIOPCITunnelledKey. Required for when getting stuck on PCI Start Configuration as there are IRQ conflicts relating to your PCI lanes. agdpmod=pikera - used for disabling boardID on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series), without this you'll get a black screen csr-active-config: Settings for SIP, generally recommended to manually change this within Recovery partition with csrutil via the recovery partition. For us, since we're running kernel patches it's recommended to keep SIP off though you can turn it back on after install and test yourself csr-active-config is set to E7030000 which effectively disables SIP. You can choose a number of other options to enable/disable sections of SIP. Some common ones are as follows: 00000000 - SIP completely enabled 30000000 - Allow unsigned kexts and writing to protected fs locations E7030000 - SIP completely disabled nvda_drv: <> For enabling Nvidia WebDrivers, set to 31 if running a Maxwell or Pascal GPU. This is the same as setting nvda_drv=1 but instead we translate it from text to hex. AMD and Intel GPU users should leave this area blank. prev-lang:kbd: <> Needed for non-Latin keyboards in the format of lang-COUNTRY:keyboard, recommended to keep blank though you can specify it(Default in Sample config is Russian): American: en-US:0(656e2d55533a30 in HEX) Full list can be found in AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt Block: Forcibly rewrites NVRAM variables, do note that Add will not overwrite values already present in NVRAM so values like boot-args should be left. LegacyEnable: NO Allows for NVRAM to be stored on nvram.plist, needed for systems without native NVRAM LegacyOverwrite: NO Permits overwriting firmware variables from nvram.plist, only needed for systems without native NVRAM LegacySchema Used for assigning NVRAM variables, used with LegacyEnable set to YES WriteFlash: YES Enables writing to flash memory for all added variables. Platforminfo For setting up the SMBIOS info, we'll use CrpNewt's GenSMBIOS application. For this example, we'll choose the iMacPro1,1 SMBIOS but some SMBIOS play with certain GPUs better than others: iMacPro1,1: AMD RX Polaris and newer MacPro7,1: AMD RX Polaris and newer(Note that MacPro7,1 is also a Catalina exclusive) MacPro6,1: AMD R5/R7/R9 and older iMac14,2: Nvidia Kepler and newer GenSMBIOS would give us output similar to the following: ####################################################### # iMacPro1,1 SMBIOS Info # ####################################################### Type: iMacPro1,1 Serial: C02YX0TZHX87 Board Serial: C029269024NJG36CB SmUUID: DEA17B2D-2F9F-4955-B266-A74C47678AD3 The order is Product | Serial | Board Serial (MLB) The Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName. The Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber. The Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB. The SmUUID part gets copied toto Generic -> SystemUUID. We set Generic -> ROM to either an Apple ROM (dumped from a real Mac), your NIC MAC address, or any random MAC address (could be just 6 random bytes, for this guide we'll use 11223300 0000) Reminder that you want valid serial numbers but those not in use, you want to get a message back like: \"Purchase Date not Validated\" Apple Check Coverage page Automatic: YES Generates PlatformInfo based on Generic section instead of DataHub, NVRAM, and SMBIOS sections SpoofVendor: YES Swaps vendor field for Acidanthera, generally not safe to use Apple as a vendor in most case SupportsCsm: NO Used for when the EFI partition isn't first on the windows drive UpdateDataHub: YES Update Data Hub fields UpdateNVRAM: YES Update NVRAM fields UpdateSMBIOS: YES Updates SMBIOS fields UpdateSMBIOSMode: Create Replace the tables with newly allocated EfiReservedMemoryType, use Custom on Dell laptops requiring CustomSMBIOSGuid quirk UEFI ConnectDrivers: YES Forces .efi drivers, change to NO will automatically connect added UEFI drivers. This can make booting slightly faster, but not all drivers connect themselves. E.g. certain file system drivers may not load. Drivers: Add your .efi drivers here Input: Related to boot.efi keyboard passthrough used for FileVault and Hotkey support KeyForgetThreshold: 5 The delay between each key input when holding a key down, for best results use 5 milliseconds KeyMergeThreshold: 2 The length of time that a key will be registered before resetting, for best results use 2 milliseconds KeySupport: YES Enables OpenCore's built in key support and required for boot picker selection, do not use with AppleUsbKbDxe.efi KeySupportMode: Auto Keyboard translation for OpenCore KeySwap: NO Swaps Option and Cmd key PointerSupport: Used for fixing broken pointer support, commonly used for Z87 Asus boards. Leave blank PointerSupportMode: Specifies OEM protocol, currently only supports Z87 and Z97 ASUS boards so leave blank TimerResolution: 50000 Set architecture timer resolution, Asus Z87 boards use 60000 for the interface. Settings to 0 can also work for some Protocols: (Most values can be ignored here as they're meant for real Macs/VMs) AppleSmcIo: NO Reinstalls Apple SMC I/O, this is the equivlant of VirtualSMC.efi which is only needed for users using FileVault ConsoleControl: YES Replaces Console Control protocol with a builtin version, set to YES otherwise you may see text output during booting instead of nice Apple logo. Required for most APTIO firmware FirmwareVolume: NO Fixes UI regarding Filevault, set to YES for better FileVault compatibility HashServices: NO Fixes incorrect cursor size when running FileVault, set to YES for better FileVault compatibility UnicodeCollation: NO Some older firmware have broken Unicode collation, fixes UEFI shell compatibility on these systems(generally IvyBridge and older) Quirks: AvoidHighAlloc: NO Workaround for when te motherboard can't properly access higher memory in UEFI Boot Services. Avoid unless necessary(affected models: GA-Z77P-D3 (rev. 1.1)) ExitBootServicesDelay: 0 Only required for very specific use cases like setting to 5 for ASUS Z87-Pro running FileVault2 IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio: NO Fix for when MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) can't be disabled in the BIOS, required for all pre-skylake based systems IgnoreTextInGraphics: NO Fix for UI corruption when both text and graphics outputs happen, set to YES with SanitiseClearScreen also set to YES for pure Apple Logo(no verbose screen) ProvideConsoleGop: YES Enables GOP(Graphics output Protcol) which the macOS bootloader requires for console handle, required for seeing once the kernel takes over ReleaseUsbOwnership: NO Releases USB controller from firmware driver, needed for when your firmware doesn't support EHCI/XHCI Handoff. Clover equivalent is FixOwnership RequestBootVarFallback: YES Request fallback of some Boot prefixed variables from OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID to EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID. Used for fixing boot options. RequestBootVarRouting: YES Redirects AptioMemeoryFix from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC\\_VENDOR\\_VARIABLE\\_GUID. Needed for when firmware tries to delete boot entries and is recommended to be enabled on all systems for correct update installation, Startup Disk control panel functioning, etc. ReplaceTabWithSpace: NO Depending on the firmware, some system may need this to properly edit files in the UEFI shell when unable to handle Tabs. This swaps it for spaces instead-but majority can ignore it but do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed SanitiseClearScreen: NO Fixes High resolutions displays that display OpenCore in 1024x768, recommened for user with 1080P+ displays ClearScreenOnModeSwitch: NO Needed for when half of the previously drawn image remains, will force black screen before switching to TextMode. Do note that ConsoleControl set to True may be needed UnblockFsConnect: NO Some firmware block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, which results in File System protocols being unable to install. Mainly relevant for HP systems when no drives are listed Cleaning up And now you're ready to save and place it into your EFI under EFI/OC. For those having booting issues, please make sure to read the Troubleshooting section first and if your questions are still unanswered we have plenty of resources at your disposal: AMD OS X Discord r/Hackintosh Subreddit Post-install So what in the world needs to be done once everything is installed? Well here's some things: USB mapping Disable OpenCore logging Enabling FileVault and other security features Fixing iMessage Correcting audio, reread the DeviceProperties on how Moving OpenCore from the USB to your main drive Mount USB's EFI Copy EFI folder to the desktop Unmount USB and mount boot drive's EFI Paste EFI onto the root of the drive "},"post-install/nvram.html":{"url":"post-install/nvram.html","title":"Emulated NVRAM","keywords":"","body":"Emulated NVRAM Last edited: January 13, 2020 So this section is for those who don't have native NVRAM, the most common hardware to have incompatible native NVRAM with macOS are the non-Z370 300 series chipsets: B360 B365 H310 H370 Q370 Z390 Some X99 and X299 (verify if you have working NVRAM below) Cleaning out the Clover gunk So some may not have noticed but Clover may have installed RC scripts into macOS for proper NVRAM emulation. This is an issue as it conflicts with OpenCore's method of emulation.

If a line containing myvar test returns, your NVRAM is working. Note: nvram -c requires SIP to be off, an alternative is to wipe NVRAM at the boot menu. Reminder you'll need Misc -> Security -> AllowNvramReset -> YES Enabling emulated NVRAM (with a nvram.plist) To enable emulated NVRAM, you'll need 3 things set: Within your config.plist: Booter: DisableVariableWrite: set to YES Misc -> Secuirty: ExposeSensitiveData: set to 0x3 NVRAM: LegacyEnable: set to YES LegacyOverwrite set to YES LegacySchema: NVRAM variables set(OpenCore compares these to the variables present in nvram.plist) ExposeSensitiveData: set to 0x3 And within your EFI: FwRuntimeServices.efi driver(this is needed for proper sleep, shutdown and other services to work correctly Now grab the 'LogoutHook.command' and place it somewhere safe (e.g. within your user directory, as shown below): /Users/(your username)/LogoutHook/LogoutHook.command Open up terminal and run the following: sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /Users/(your username)/LogoutHook/LogoutHook.command And voila! You have emulated NVRAM! Do keep in mind this requires the nvram command to support the -x flag for this to work correctly which is unavailable on macOS 10.12 and below. If you are installing macOS 10.12 or earlier, you need to copy nvram.mojave into the same folder as LogoutHook.command, which fixes this by invoking it instead of the system nvram command. Something else to note is that macOS is only able to read nvram.plist but it won't be able to write to nvram.plist unless running the shutdown process.

Well with OpenCore things are slightly different, specifically that we need to specify to which exact device we want to spoof. There are 3 ways we can do this: Boot Flag Disables all GPUs except the iGPU DeviceProperties Disables GPU on a per-slot basis SSDT Disables GPU on a per-slot basis CSM must be off in the BIOS for the spoofing to work correctly, especially on AMD CPU based systems Boot Flag By far the simplest way, all you need to do is add the following boot-arg: -wegnoegpu Do note that this will disable all GPUs excluding the iGPU DevicePropeties Method Here is quite simple, find the PCI route with gfxutil and then create a new DeviceProperties section with your spoof: path/to/gfxutil -f GFX0 And the output will result in something similar: DevicePath = PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0) With this, navigate towards Root -> DeviceProperties -> Add and add your PCI route with the following properties: Key Type Value name data 23646973706C6179 IOName string #display class-code data FFFFFFFF SSDT Method There are many ways to find the path but generally, the easiest way is to get into Device Manager under windows and find the PCI path. Example of device path: \\_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP DefinitionBlock (\"\", \"SSDT\", 2, \"hack\", \"spoof\", 0x00000000) { External (_SB_.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP, DeviceObj) // (from opcode) Method (_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP._DSM, 4, NotSerialized) // _DSM: Device-Specific Method { If (LOr (LNot (Arg2), LEqual (_OSI (\"Darwin\"), Zero))) { Return (Buffer (One) { 0x03 }) } Return (Package (0x0A) { \"name\", Buffer (0x09) { \"#display\" }, \"IOName\", \"#display\", \"class-code\", Buffer (0x04) { 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF }, \"vendor-id\", Buffer (0x04) { 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00 }, \"device-id\", Buffer (0x04) { 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00 } }) } } A copy of this SSDT can be found here: Spoof-SSDT.dsl You will need MaciASL to compile this, reminder that .aml is assembled and .dsl is source code. You can compile with MaciASL by running File -> Save As -> ACPI Machine Language. Source: CorpNewt Fixing Windows So something that many users are annoyed about is the fact that you need to switch between GPU outputs. Well a neat little trick on Windows is that you can reroute your display options to a specific GPU: "},"post-install/security.html":{"url":"post-install/security.html","title":"Security and FileVault","keywords":"","body":"Security and FileVault Last edited: January 13, 2020 So something that makes OpenCore truly special is how it's been built with security in mind which is quite rare especially in the Hackintosh community. Well here we'll be going through setting up FileVault and talking about 2 features of OpenCore: ScanPolicy Vault(work in progress) FileVault Setup To start, you'll need the following .efi drivers: FwRuntimeServices.efi AppleUsbKbDxe.efi may be needed if OpenCore's built-in input doesn't work Do not use VirtualSMC.efi with OpenCore, its already baked inside Setting in your config.plist: Misc -> Boot PollAppleHotKeys set to YES(While not needed can be helpful) Misc -> Security AuthRestart set to YES(Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be concidered a secuirty risk so optional) NVRAM -> Add -> 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 UIScale set to 02 for high resolution small displays UEFI -> Input KeySupport set to YES(Only when using OpenCore's builtin input, users of UsbKbdxe should avoid) UEFI -> Protocols FirmwareVolume set to YES HashServices set to YES for Haswell and older(this includes X99), this is needed for systems with broken SHA-1 hashing AppleSmcIo set to YES(this replaces VirtualSMC.efi) UEFI -> Quirks ProvideConsoleGOP to YES RequestBootVarRouting set to YES ExitBootServicesDelay set to 5 if you recieve Still waiting for root device on Aptio IV firmwares(Haswell and older) With all this, you can proceed to enable FileVault like on a normal mac under System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> FileVault Scan Policy What this quirk allows to prevent scanning and booting from untrusted sources. Setting to 0 will allow all sources present to be bootable but calculating a specific ScanPolicy value will allow you a greater range of flexibilty and security. To calculate the ScanPolicy value, you simply add up all the hexidecimal values(with a hexideciaml calculator, you can access this from the built-in macOS caluclator app with ⌘+3). Once it's all added up, you would add this hexidecimal value to ScanPolicy(you will need to convert it to a decimal value first, Xcode will automatically convert it when you paste it) 0x00000001 (bit 0) — OC_SCAN_FILE_SYSTEM_LOCK restricts scanning to only known file systems defined as a part of this policy. File system drivers may not be aware of this policy, and to avoid mounting of undesired file systems it is best not to load its driver. This bit does not affect dmg mounting, which may have any file system. Known file systems are prefixed with OCSCAN_ALLOW_FS. 0x00000002 (bit 1) — OC_SCAN_DEVICE_LOCK restricts scanning to only known device types defined as a part of this policy. This is not always possible to detect protocol tunneling, so be aware that on some systems it may be possible for e.g. USB HDDs to be recognised as SATA. Cases like this must be reported. Known device types are prefixed with OCSCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE. 0x00000100 (bit 8) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_APFS allows scanning of APFS file system. 0x00000200 (bit 9) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_HFS allows scanning of HFS file system. 0x00000400 (bit 10) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_ESP allows scanning of EFI System Partition file system. 0x00010000 (bit 16) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SATA allow scanning SATA devices. 0x00020000 (bit 17) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SASEX allow scanning SAS and Mac NVMe devices. 0x00040000 (bit 18) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SCSI allow scanning SCSI devices. 0x00080000 (bit 19) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_NVME allow scanning NVMe devices. 0x00100000 (bit 20) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_ATAPI allow scanning CD/DVD devices. 0x00200000 (bit 21) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_USB allow scanning USB devices. 0x00400000 (bit 22) - OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_FIREWIRE allow scanning FireWire devices. 0x00800000 (bit 23) — OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SDCARD allow scanning card reader devices. By default, ScanPolicy is given a value of 0xF0103(983,299) which is the combination of the following: OC_SCAN_FILE_SYSTEM_LOCK OC_SCAN_DEVICE_LOCK OC_SCAN_ALLOW_FS_APFS OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SATA OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SASEX OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_SCSI OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_NVME And lets just say for this example that you want to add OC_SCAN_ALLOW_DEVICE_USB: 0x00200000 + 0xF0103 = 0x2F0103 And converting this to decimal gives us 3,080,451 Vault Work in progress What is vaulting?

Turn the following off under Misc -> Security: RequireSignature RequireVault If you have already executed the commands listed in the OpenCore Reference Manual under 8.5 Security Properties, 5. RequireVault, you'll need to restore your OpenCore.efi file. Stuck on EndRandomSeed Couple problems: ProvideConsoleGop is likely missing as this is needed for transitioning to the next screen, this was originally part of AptioMemoryFix but is now within OpenCore as this quirk Missing kernel patches(only applies for AMD CPUs) Another possible problem is that some users either forget or cannot disable CFG-Lock in the BIOS(specifically relating to a locked 0xE2 MSR bit for power management, obviously much safer to turn off CFG-Lock). Do note this is for Intel users only. When this happens, there's a couple of possible fixes: Fixing CFG Lock Enable AppleXcpmCfgLock and AppleCpuPmCfgLock, this disables PKG_CST_CNFIG_CONTROL within the XNU and AppleIntelCPUPowerManagment respectively. Not recommended long term solution as this can cause instability. Another other possible problem is IRQ conflicts, Clover has plenty of different fixes that it can apply without you directly setting them.

For us what we care about is layout 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, we want to test each one individually until you find a layout that works best for you. Remember that the DeviceProperty is in HEX, converting 5 to HEX becomes 05000000 and converting 11 to HEX becomes 0B000000 .

Well don't fret, there's hope for you! OpenCore supports DuetPkg which emulates a UEFI environment for legacy systems. To start, you need the following: BootInstall.command Install source(MacOS Journaled + GUID, size of USb depends on the version of macOS. 16GB recommended for catalina) Within your OpenCore build folder, navigate to Utilities/BootInstall. Here you'll find a file called BootInstall.command. What this does is install DuetPkg to your desired drive. Now you'll want to run BootInstall.command, do note that you may need sudo for this to work correctly on newer versions of macOS sudo Utilities/BootInstall/BootInstall.command This will give you a list of available disks, choose yours and you will be prompted to write a new MBR. Choose yes[y] and you'll be finished. This will provide you with an EFI partition with a boot file, this is where we'll add our OpenCore EFI. Note: You will need AppleUsbKbDxe.efi for picker support "},"extras/acpi.html":{"url":"extras/acpi.html","title":"Getting started with ACPI","keywords":"","body":"Getting started with ACPI Last edited: January 16, 2020 A quick explainer on ACPI and how to make SSDTs So what are DSDTs and SSDTs? Well, these are tables present in your firmware that outline hardware devices like USB controllers, CPU threads, embedded controllers, system clocks and such. A DSDT(Differentiated System Description Table) can be seen as the body holding most of the info with smaller bits of info being passed by the SSDT(Secondary System Description Table) So why do we care about these tables? macOS can be very picky about the devices present in the DSDT and so our job is to correct it. The main devices that need to be corrected for macOS to work properly: Embedded controllers(EC) All semi-modern intel machines have an EC exposed in their DSDT, with many AMD systems also having it exposed. These controllers are not compatible with macOS so then need to be hidden from macOS and replaced with a dummy EC when running macOS Catalina Plugin type This is used to enable native CPU power management on Intel Haswell and newer CPUs, the SSDT will connect to the first thread of the CPU. For Intel CPUs only, for AMD see NullCPUPowerManagement patch AWAC system clock. This applies to all 300 series motherboards including Z370 boards, the specific issue is that newer boards ship with AWAC clock enabled. This is a problem because macOS cannot communicate with AWAC clocks, so this requires us to either force on the Legacy RTC clock or if unavailable create a fake one for macOS to play with Getting a copy of our DSDT So to get a copy of your DSDT there's a couple of options: MaciASL Open the app on the target machine and the system's DSDT will show, then File -> SaveAs System DSDT. Make sure the file format is ACPI Machine Language Binary(.AML), this will require the machine to be running macOS Do note that all ACPI patches from clover/OpenCore will be applied to the DSDT SSDTTime Supports both Windows and Linux for DSDT dumping acpidump.exe In command prompt run path/to/acpidump.exe -b -n DSDT -z, this will dump your DSDT as a .dat file. Rename this to DSDT.aml F4 in Clover Boot menu DSDT can be found in EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/origin, the folder must exist before dumping acpidump.efi Add this to EFI/OC/Tools and in your config under Misc -> Tools with the argument: -b -n DSDT -z and select this option in OpenCore's picker. Rename the DSDT.dat to DSDT.aml. Tool is provided by acpica If OpenCore is having issues running acpidump, you can call it from the shell with OpenCoreShell(reminder to add to both EFI/OC/Tools and in your config under Misc -> Tools ): shell> fs0: // replace with proper drive fs0:\\> dir // to verify this is the right directory Directory of fs0:\\ 01/01/01 3:30p EFI fs0:\\> cd EFI\\OC\\Tools // note that it's with forward slashes fs0:\\EFI\\OC\\Tools> acpidump.efi -b -n DSDT -z Compiling and decompiling DSDTs and SSDTs macOS So compiling DSDTs and SSDTs are quite easy with macOS, all you need is MaciASL. To compile, just File -> SaveAs -> ACPI Machine Language Binary(.AML), decompiling is just opening the file in MaciASL. Windows Compiling and decompiling on windows is fairly simple though, you will need iasl.exe and Command Prompt: path/to/iasl.exe path/to/DSDT.aml If compiled .aml file is provided, a decompiled .dsl file will be given and vice versa. Linux Compiling and decompiling with Linux is just as simple, you will need a special copy of iasl and terminal: path/to/iasl path/to/DSDT.aml If compiled .aml file is provided, a decompiled .dsl file will be given and vice versa. Creating SSDTs EC SSDT This one's fairly easy to figure out, open your decompiled DSDT and search for PNP0C09. This should give you a result like this: As you can see our PNP0C09 is found within the Device (EC0) meaning this is the device we want to hide from macOS(others may find ). Now grab our SSDT-EC and uncomment the EC0 function(remove the /* and */ around it): SSDT-EC-USBX For Skylake+ and all AMD systems SSDT-EC For Haswell and older /* But looking back at the screenshot above we notice something, our ACPI path is different: PC00.LPC0 vs PCI0.LPCB. This is very important especially when you're dealing with Intel consumer vs Intel HEDT and AMD, PC00.LPC0 is common on Intel HEDT while PCI0.SBRG is common on AMD. And they even come with name variation such as EC0, H_EC, PGEC and ECDV, so there can't be a one size fits all SSDT, always verify your path and device. And make sure to scroll to the bottom as the new Fake EC function also need the correct path to replace the old EC. What happens if multiple PNP0C09 show up When this happens you need to figure out which is the main and which is not, it's fairly easy to figure out. Check each controller for the following properties: _HID _CRS _GPE What happens if no PNP0C09 show up? This means your SSDT can be almost complied, the main thing to watch for is whether your DSDT uses PCI0.LPCB or not. The reason being is that we have a FakeEC at the bottom of our SSDT that needs to connect properly into our DSDT. Gernally AMD uses SBRG while Intel HEDT use LPC0, verify which show up in your DSDT. Once you find out, change PCI0.LPCB to your correct path: Scope (\\_SB.PCI0.LPCB) { Device (EC) { Name (_HID, \"ACID0001\") // _HID: Hardware ID Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized) // _STA: Status { If (_OSI (\"Darwin\")) { Return (0x0F) } Else { Return (Zero) } } } } Hey what about USBX? Do I need to do anything? USBX is universal across all systems, it just creates a USBX device that forces USB power properties. This is crucial for fixing Mics, DACs, Webcams, Bluetooth Dongles and other high power draw devices. This is not mandatory to boot but should be added in post-install if not before. Note that USBX is only used on skylake+ systems, Broadwell and older can ignore and that USBX requires a patched EC to function correctly For those who want a deeper dive into the EC issue: What's new in macOS Catalina PLUG SSDT Intel CPUs only, for AMD see NullCPUPowerManagement patch CPU naming is fairly easy to figure out as well, open your decompiled DSDT and search for Processor. This should give you a result like this: As we can see, the first processor in our list is PR00. This is what we'll be applying the plugin-type=1 property too. Now grab SSDT-PLUG and replace the default CPU0 with our PR00. Note that there are 2 mentions of CPU0 in the SSDT. There are also some edge cases with Processor, specifically on HEDT series like X79, X99 and X299. This edge case is that the ACPI path is much longer and not so obvious: If we then search for instances of CP00 we find that it's ACPI path is SB.SCK0.CP00: So for this X299 board, we'd change \\_PR.CPU0 with \\_SB.SCK0.CP00 and External (_PR_.CPU0, ProcessorObj) with External (_SB_.SCK0.CP00, ProcessorObj) AWAC SSDT This is required for most B360, B365, H310, H370, Z390 and even some newer BIOS revisions on Z370 like the Gigabyte Z370 Aurus Ultra firmware version 13+ What the SSDT-AWAC will do is force enable the Legacy RTC device in macOS, the reason we want to do this is that macOS currently does not support AWAC as a system clock. In some rare cases, there is no Legacy RTC device to force enable so we'll need to create a fake RTC device for macOS to play with using SSDT-RTC0 To determine whether you need SSDT-AWAC or SSDT-RTC0, open your decompiled DSDT and search for AWAC. If you get a result then you have an AWAC system clock present, if nothing shows then no need to continue. Next search for STAS: As you can see we found the STAS in our DSDT, this means we're able to force enable our Legacy RTC. In this case, SSDT-AWAC will be used As-Is with no modifications required. Just need to compile. For systems where no STAS shows up, you can use SSDT-RTC0 though you will need to check whether your DSDT uses LPCB, LBC or LBC0. By default it uses LPCB, you can check by just searching for instances of LPCB, LBC and LBC0 Cleaning up Now that we have all our SSDTs compiled, the last thing to do is add our SSDTs to both EFI/OC/ACPI and our config under ACPI -> Add. A reminder that ProperTree users can press the hotkey Cmd/Ctrl+R for automatically adding your SSDTs to the config. A reminder that there is no need to add your DSDT as its already inside your firmware.

Specifcally that you need to have the PCIRoot path to apply the properties. Luckily FakeIDs are not required to boot, instead only needed for proper GPU acceleration so this can be done in post-install. Finding the PCIRoot of your GPU To find the PCIRoot, you'll want to grab gfxutil and run the following in terminal: path/to/gfxutil -f GFX0 This should give you something like this: PciRoot(0x20)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0) Note: GFX0 can be replaced with GFX1, etc if the GPU you're fakeIDing isn't the first/main GPU. And machine running with CSM enabled and Windows8.1/10 mode(WHQL) disabled may find that the GPU is named display so adjust the above command accodingly. Apply the fakeID So lets grab a clover fakeID and go through how we'd convert it, for use we'll choose 0x67981002 which is the ID associated with the R9 280x and is commonly used by R9 280/380 users. Looking through clover's source code we find that fakeIDs are converted into the following properties: AMD GPUs: device-id ATY,DeviceID @0,compatible vendor-id ATY,VendorID To convert them, we'll need to do byte swap. This is due to Endianness: DeviceID: 67 98 -> 98 67 VendorID: 1002 -> 02 10 Now we can apply the properties: Key Type Value device-id Data 98670000 ATY,DeviceID Data 9867 vendor-id Data 02100000 ATY,VendorID Data 0210 You may notice we excluded @0,compatible, the reasoning for this is thatit actually interferes with WhateverGreen and macOS's ability to properly setup the GPU. See here for more info. Now navigate into your config.plist under DeviceProperties -> Add where you can apply these properties: iGPU BusID Patching This section is for users running \"true\" 300 series motherboards( B360, B365, H310, H370, Z390) who are having issues setting up their iGPU as a display out.

For use we care about this: [1] busId: 0x05, pipe: 9, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x000003C7 - DP [2] busId: 0x04, pipe: 10, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x000003C7 - DP [3] busId: 0x06, pipe: 8, type: 0x00000400, flags: 0x000003C7 - DP 01050900 00040000 C7030000 02040A00 00040000 C7030000 03060800 00040000 C7030000 These are your iGPUs ports by default, lets go through port 1 and see what each section is used for: The first port: 01050900 00040000 C7030000 Port: 01 01050900 00040000 C7030000 busId: 0x05 01050900 00040000 C7030000 Pipe Number 9 (little endian): 01050900 00040000 C7030000 Connector type: DisplayPort 01050900 00040000 C7030000 Flags - We leave it as default: 01050900 00040000 C7030000 Things to note: You cannot use the same busId twice, having 2 in use will create conflicts Pipe number and flags don't need to changed List of connector types: 00 04 00 00 - DisplayPort 00 08 00 00 - HDMI 04 00 00 00 - Digital DVI 02 00 00 00 - LVDS (for laptops) 01 00 00 00 - Dummy port Mapping video ports Plug display into HDMI port Set Port 1 to the HDMI connector type: 01xx0900 00080000 C7030000 Disable ports 2 and 3 with busid=00: 02000A00 00040000 C7030000 03000800 00040000 C7030000 Walk through busids for Port 1 if the previous didn't work(yup you gotta do a shit ton of reboots). The maximum busid on most platforms is 0x06 01010900 00080000 C7030000 01020900 00080000 C7030000 01030900 00080000 C7030000 etc If you still get no output, set port 1's busid to 00 and start going through busids for port 2 and so on 01000900 00040000 C7030000 02xx0A00 00080000 C7030000 03000800 00040000 C7030000 Adding to your config.plist So adding these patches are simple though a bunch of entires are required: framebuffer-con0-enable = 01000000 framebuffer-con1-enable = 01000000 framebuffer-con2-enable = 01000000 framebuffer-con0-alldata = port 1 framebuffer-con1-alldata = port 2 framebuffer-con2-alldata = port 3 So when adding the patches, port 1 will actually become con0 as the ports start at 0. These are also all data types when entering your values. A finished config should look something like this: "},"extras/kalsr-fix.html":{"url":"extras/kalsr-fix.html","title":"Fixing KALSR slide values","keywords":"","body":"Fixing KALSR slide values Last editied: January 13, 2020 Fixing KALSR slide values This section is for users who wish to understand and fix \"Couldn't allocate runtime area\" errors. This is most common with either Z390, X99 and X299. This section will also support Clover as the info is also useful for them. So what is KASLR? Well KASLR stands for Kernel address space layout randomization, what it's used for is security purposes. Specifically, this makes it much harder for attackers to figure out where the important objects are in memory as it's always random both between machines and between boots. More in-depth explainer on KASLR Where this becomes an issue is when you introduce devices with either small memory maps or just way too many devices present. There likely is space for the kernel to operate but there's also free space where the kernel won't fit entirely. This is where slide=xxx fits in. Instead of letting macOS choose a random area to operate in each boot, we'll constrain it to somewhere that we know will work. And who is this info for? Well as I mentioned earlier, this is for users who don't have enough space for the kernel or moves to a place that is too small. You'll generally experience an error similar to this when booting: Error allocating 0x1197b pages at 0x0000000017a80000 alloc type 2 Couldn't allocate runtime area With some variation: Only 244/256 slide values are usable! Or even crashes while running macOS: panic(cpu 6 caller 0xffffff801fc057ba): a freed zone element has been modified in zone kalloc.4096: expected 0x3f00116dbe8a46f6 but found 0x3f00116d00000000 The best part about these errors is that they can be random, also the reason why power cycling your PC 20 times also can fix the issue but only temporarily. Fun Fact: It takes around 31 ms to find an area to operate in, manually setting a slide value can on average can reduce boot times by 0.207%!!! So how do I fix this? The real fix to this is quite simple actually, the process is both the same for Clover and OpenCore users. What you'll need: Clover users: AptioMemoryFix(Don't mix Aptio fixes together or use OsxAptioFixDrvX, only AptioMemoryFix is supported in this guide) Clover Shell(most users already have this included, usually called shell64.efi or some variation) OpenCore users: FwRuntimeServices OpenCoreShell(Don't forget to enable this under Root->Misc->Tools) Config.plist settings: AvoidRuntimeDefrag: Fixes UEFI runtime services like date, time, NVRAM, etc DevirtualiseMmio: Reduces stolen memory footprint so we're given more options for slide values DisableVariableWrite: Reroutes NVRAM to nvram.plist, needed for systems without supported NVRAM(B360, B365, H310, H370, Q370, Z390). Some C612, X79, X99, X299 systems will also need this. EnableSafeModeSlide: Allows us to use slide in safe mode, just so if you have other issues troubleshooting won't mess it up. EnableWriteUnprotector: Allows us to write to certain areas that the firmware locks, specifically the CR0 register. ProvideCustomSlide: Kinda need that slide to do any real work. SetupVirtualMap: Creates a layer between macOS and your memory map for greater support and fewer chances of insecure write access. ShrinkMemoryMap: Fixes issues with very large memory maps that don't fit, very useful for X99 and X299 platforms and sometimes for Z390. Prepping the BIOS The reason we need to reset the memory map is we want it to be more deterministic, what I mean by this is that there will be less variation on each boot so we have fewer edge cases(Memory Maps are not always consistent on boots). To prep: Update BIOS(extremely important as early BIOS's shipped are known to have memory map issues, especially with Z390) Clear CMOS Enable much needed BIOS settings: Above4GDecoding: This allows devices to use memory regions above 4GB meaning macOS will have more room to fit, can be problematic on some X99, X299 so recommended to test with and without. Boot Options -> Windows8.1/10 mode: This will make sure no old legacy garbage is loaded. Fun fact, other OS is only designed for booting older versions of Windows and not for other OS. Disable as many unneeded devices in the BIOS(this means there is less variation in the map on each boot, so fewer chances of boot failure). Common settings: CSM: For legacy support, adds a bunch of garbage we don't want. This also can break the shell so you can't boot into it. Intel SGX: Software Guard Extensions, takes up a lot of space and does nothing in macOS. Parallel Port: macOS can't even see parallel. Serial Port: I'd like to know how many of you are debugging the kernel... iGPU: Not ideal but some systems have such bloated maps that the iGPU just can't fit. Thunderbolt: Many hacks don't have thunderbolt working, boards that don't have thunderbolt but have this option just waste more space. LED lighting: Sorry mate, time to go. Legacy USB: More Legacy Crap. Finding the Slide value Now what you'll want to do is open the EFI shell in your boot manager of choice and run memmap. This will give you a list of all pages and their sizes. This is where the fun begins.

What we're interested in is the largest available value within the Start column. In this example we see that 000000006B626000 is our largest, do note that these are in HEX so if there are multiple values close to each other you may need to convert them to decimal. To the calculate slide value(macOS's built-in calculator has a programming function by pressing ⌘+3): 000000006B626000 = 0x6B626000 (0x6B626000 - 0x100000)/0x200000 = 0x35A And to verify that this is correct: 0x100000 + (0x35A * 0x200000) = 0x6B500000 Whenever the returned value is not the original(0x6B500000 vs 0x6B626000), just add +1 to your final slide value. This is due to rounding. So for example 0x35A converted to decimal becomes 858 and then +1 will give you slide=858. But wait for just a second, this is higher than 256! That is correct, this is caused by memory maps that include Above4GDecoding sectors which cannot be used. So you will need to keep going down the list until you find a small enough value(for us that would be 0000000000100000) And just to make it a bit clearer on the formula: (HEX - 0x100000)/0x200000 = Slide Value in HEX 0x100000 + (Slide Value in HEX * 0x200000) = Your original HEX value(if not then add +1 to your slide value) Now navigate into your config.plist and add your slide value with the rest of your boot arguments(for us it would be slide=0 when using 0x100000). If this value still gives you errors then you may proceed to the second-largest Start value and so on. Sometimes you may find that when you calculate slide that you receive super small vales like slide=-0.379150390625, when this happens round this to slide=0. And for users who are having issues finding their slide value can also type $slide [insert largest #Pages value] in the #Sandbox channel on the r/Hackintosh Discord But this is soooooo hard Well fret not, for there is a simple solution. After running memmap in the shell, run: shell> fs0: //replace with proper drive fs0:\\> dir //to verify this is the right directory Directory of fs0:\\ 01/01/01 3:30p EFI fs0:\\> memmap > memmap.txt This will add a memmap.txt file to the root of your EFI for OpenCore users, you can then proceed to drop it into the r/Hackintosh discord and type $slide [insert a link to memmap.txt]. Do note that this doesn't always work so so may still need to do this manually. "},"extras/msr-lock.html":{"url":"extras/msr-lock.html","title":"Fixing CFG Lock","keywords":"","body":"Fixing CFG Lock Last editied: January 13, 2020 Disabling CFG Lock So you've installed macOS but you're using those pesky CFG-Lock patches that we want to get rid of, well to do this is fairly simple. You'll need the following: Inside your EFI/OC/Tools folder and config.plist: VerifyMsrE2 Modifed GRUB Shell And some apps to help us out: UEFITool (Make sure it's UEFITool and not UEFIExtract) Universal-IFR-Extractor And don't forget to disable the following from your config.plist: AppleCpuPmCfgLock AppleXcpmCfgLock And the final part, grabbing your BIOS from the vendors' website. Now the fun part! Checking if CFG-Lock can be turned off Boot OpenCore and select the VerifyMsrE2 option in the picker. This tool will tell you whether your BIOS supports CFG-Lock and if it can be unlocked. Turning off CFG-Lock manually Open your firmware with UEFITool and then find CFG Lock as a Unicode string. If nothing pops up then your firmware doesn't support CFG Lock, otherwise continue on. You'll find that this string is found within a Setup folder, right-click and export as Setup.bin Open your setup file with ifrextract and export as a .txt file with terminal: path/to/ifrextract path/to/Setup.bin path/to/Setup.txt Open the text file and search for CFG Lock, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): and note the offset right after it(ie: 0x5A4) Run the Modified GRUB Shell and paste the following where 0x5A4 is replaced with your value: setup_var 0x5A4 0x00 Do note that variable offsets are unique not just to each motherboard but even to its firmware version. Never try to use an offset without checking. And you're done! Now you'll have correct CPU power management Note: Every time you reset your BIOS you will need to flip this bit again, make sure to write it down with the BIOS version so you know which.
