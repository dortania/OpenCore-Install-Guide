# Gathering files

This section is for gathering miscellaneous files for booting macOS, we do expect you to know your hardware well before starting and hopefully made a Hackintosh before as we won't be deep diving in here.

> What's the best way to figure out if my hardware is supported?

See the [**Hardware Limitations page**](macos-limits.md) for some better insight into what macOS requires to boot, hardware support between Clover and OpenCore are quite similar.

> What are some ways to figure out what hardware I have?

See the page before: [Finding your hardware](./find-hardware.md)

## Firmware Drivers

Firmware drivers are drivers used by OpenCore in the UEFI environment. They're mainly required to boot a machine, either by extending OpenCore's patching ability or showing you different types of drives in the OpenCore picker(ie. HFS drives).

* **Location Note**: These files **must** be placed under `EFI/OC/Drivers/`

### Universal

::: tip Required Drivers

For the majority of systems, you'll only need 2 `.efi` drivers to get up and running:

* [HfsPlus.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData/blob/master/Drivers/HfsPlus.efi)(<span style="color:red">Required</span>)
  * Needed for seeing HFS volumes(ie. macOS Installers and Recovery partitions/images). **Do not mix other HFS drivers**
  * For Sandy Bridge and older(as well as low end Ivy Bridge(i3 and Celerons), see the legacy section below
* [OpenRuntime.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)(<span style="color:red">Required</span>)
  * Replacement for [AptioMemoryFix.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/AptioFixPkg), used as an extension for OpenCore to help with patching boot.efi for NVRAM fixes and better memory management.
  * Reminder this was bundled in OpenCorePkg we downloaded earlier

:::

### Legacy users

In addition to the above, if your hardware doesn't support UEFI(2011 and older era) then you'll need the following. Pay close attention to each entry as you may not need all 4:

* [OpenUsbKbDxe.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
  * Used for OpenCore picker on **legacy systems running DuetPkg**, [not recommended and even harmful on UEFI(Ivy Bridge and newer)](https://applelife.ru/threads/opencore-obsuzhdenie-i-ustanovka.2944066/page-176#post-856653)
* [HfsPlusLegacy.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData/blob/master/Drivers/HfsPlusLegacy.efi)
  * Legacy variant of HfsPlus, used for systems that lack RDRAND instruction support. This is generally seen on Sandy Bridge and older(as well as low end Ivy Bridge(i3 and Celerons))
  * Don't mix this with HfsPlus.efi, choose one or the other depending on your hardware
* [OpenPartitionDxe](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
  * Required to boot recovery on OS X 10.7 through 10.9
    * This file is bundled with OpenCorePkg under EFI/OC/Drivers
    * Note: OpenDuet users(ie. without UEFI) will have this driver built-in, not requiring it
  * Not required for OS X 10.10, Yosemite and newer

These files will go in your Drivers folder in your EFI

::: details 32-Bit specifics

For those with 32-Bit CPUs, you'll want to grab these drivers as well

* [HfsPlus32](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData/blob/master/Drivers/HfsPlus32.efi)
  * Alternative to HfsPlusLegacy but for 32-bit CPUs, don't mix this with other HFS .efi drivers

:::

## Kexts

A kext is a **k**ernel **ext**ension, you can think of this as a driver for macOS, these files will go into the Kexts folder in your EFI.

* **Windows and Linux note**: Kexts will look like normal folders in your OS, **double check** that the folder you are installing has a .kext extension visible(and do not add one manually if it's missing).
  * If any kext also includes a `.dSYM` file, you can simply delete it. They're only for debugging purposes.
* **Location Note**: These files **must** be placed under `EFI/OC/Kexts/`.

All kext listed below can be found **pre-compiled** in the [Kext Repo](http://kexts.goldfish64.com/). Kexts here are compiled each time there's a new commit.

### Must haves

::: tip Required Kexts

Without the below 2, no system is bootable:

* [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases)(<span style="color:red">Required</span>)
  * Emulates the SMC chip found on real macs, without this macOS will not boot
  * Requires Mac OS X 10.4 or newer
* [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu/releases)(<span style="color:red">Required</span>)
  * A kext to patch many processes, required for AppleALC, WhateverGreen, VirtualSMC and many other kexts. Without Lilu, they will not work.
  * Note that while Lilu supports as early as Mac OS X 10.4, many plugins only work on newer versions.

### VirtualSMC Plugins

The below plugins are not required to boot, and merely add extra functionality to the system like hardware monitoring (Note while VirtualSMC supports 10.4, plugins may require newer versions):

* SMCProcessor.kext
  * Used for monitoring CPU temperature, **doesn't work on AMD CPU based systems**
  * Requires Mac OS X 10.7 or newer
* [SMCAMDProcessor](https://github.com/trulyspinach/SMCAMDProcessor)
  * USed for monitoring CPU temperature on AMD Zen-based systems
  * **Under active development, potentially unstable**
  * Requires AMDCPURyzenPowerManagement (see [AMD CPU Specific Kexts](ktext.md#amd-cpu-specific-kexts))
  * Requires macOS 10.13 or newer
* SMCSuperIO.kext
  * Used for monitoring fan speed, **doesn't work on AMD CPU based systems**
  * Requires Mac OS X 10.6 or newer
* SMCLightSensor.kext
  * Used for the ambient light sensor on laptops, **desktops can ignore**
  * Do not use if you don't have an ambient light sensor, can cause issues otherwise
  * Requires Mac OS X 10.6 or newer
* SMCBatteryManager.kext
  * Used for measuring battery readouts on laptops, **desktops can ignore**
  * Requires Mac OS X 10.4 or newer
* SMCDellSensors.kext
  * Allows for finer monitoring and control of the fans on Dell machines supporting System Management Mode (SMM)
  * **Do not use if you do not have a supported Dell machine**, mainly Dell laptops can benefit from this kext
  * Requires Mac OS X 10.7 or newer

### Graphics

* [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)(<span style="color:red">Required</span>)
  * Used for graphics patching, DRM fixes, board ID checks, framebuffer fixes, etc; all GPUs benefit from this kext.
  * Note the SSDT-PNLF.dsl file included is only required for laptops and AIOs, see [Getting started with ACPI](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/) for more info
  * Requires Mac OS X 10.6 or newer

### Audio

* [AppleALC](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/releases)
  * Used for AppleHDA patching, allowing support for the majority of on-board sound controllers
  * AppleALCU.kext is a pared down version of AppleALC that only supports digital audio - but you can still use AppleALC.kext on digital audio-only systems
  * AMD 15h/16h may have issues with AppleALC and Ryzen/Threadripper systems rarely have mic support
  * Requires OS X 10.8 or newer
  
::: details Legacy Audio Kext

For those who plan to boot 10.7 and older may want to opt for these kexts instead:

* [VoodooHDA](https://sourceforge.net/projects/voodoohda/)
  * Requires OS X 10.6 or newer
  
* [VoodooHDA-FAT](https://github.com/khronokernel/Legacy-Kexts/blob/master/FAT/Zip/VoodooHDA.kext.zip)
  * Similar to the above, however supports 32 and 64-Bit kernels so perfect for OS X 10.4-5 booting and 32-Bit CPUs

:::

## SSDTs

So you see all those SSDTs in the AcpiSamples folder and wonder whether you need any of them. For us, we will be going over what SSDTs you need in **your specific ACPI section of the config.plist**, as the SSDTs you need are platform specific. With some even system specific where they need to be configured and you can easily get lost if I give you a list of SSDTs to choose from now.

[Getting started with ACPI](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/) has an extended section on SSDTs including compiling them on different platforms.

A quick TL;DR of needed SSDTs(This is source code, you will have to compile them into a .aml file):
