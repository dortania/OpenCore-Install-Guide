# Making the installer in Windows

* Supported version: 0.6.1

While you don't need a fresh install of macOS to use OpenCore, some users prefer having a fresh slate with their boot manager upgrades.

To start you'll need the following:

* 4GB USB Stick
* [GibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS)

## Downloading macOS

To start, open gibMacOS.bat as Admin and select `Toggle Recovery-Only`:

Now search through for your desired version of macOS, for this example we'll choose option 5 for macOS Catalina:

This will download the RecoveryHDMetaDmg.pkg to `\gibmacos-master\macOS Downloads\publicrelease\xxx-xxxxx - 10.x.x macOS xxx`

## Making the installer

Next open `MakeInstall.bat` as Admin and select your drive with option O for OpenCore( ex: 1O).

Once your drive is formatted, it will then ask you for the `RecoveryHDMetaDMG.pkg` that we downloaded earlier. Top left of the file window will let you copy the file path:

MakeInstall will finish up by installing OpenCore to your USB's EFI System Partition, you can find this partition labeled as `BOOT`:

## Now with all this done, head to [Setting up the EFI](../installer-guide/opencore-efi.md) to finish up your work
