# Legacy macOS: Online Method

This method allows us to download legacy versions of macOS including 10.7 to current, however these are only recovery installers so require an internet connection inside the installer itself

To start, you'll want to use macrecovery.py instead. This tool is actually already bundled in OpenCorePkg:

Instructions for running are quite simple, choose from one of the below commands depending on which OS you want to download:

```sh
# Lion (10.7):
python3 ./macrecovery.py -b Mac-2E6FAB96566FE58C -m 00000000000F25Y00 download

* **macOS 12 and above note**: As recent macOS versions introduce changes to the USB stack, it is highly advisable that you map your USB ports (with USBToolBox) before installing macOS.
  * <span style="color:red"> CAUTION: </span> With macOS 11.3 and newer, [XhciPortLimit is broken resulting in boot loops](https://github.com/dortania/bugtracker/issues/162).
    * If you've already [mapped your USB ports](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/) and disabled `XhciPortLimit`, you can boot macOS 11.3+ without issues.

From here, run one of those commands in terminal and once finished you'll get an output similar to this:

Once this is done, format your USB as FAT32 with GUID Partition Scheme:

And finally, create folder on the root of this drive called `com.apple.recovery.boot` and place the newly downloaded BaseSystem/RecoveryImage files in:

### Once you're finished, you can head to [Setting up OpenCore's EFI environment](./mac-install.md#setting-up-opencore-s-efi-environment)
