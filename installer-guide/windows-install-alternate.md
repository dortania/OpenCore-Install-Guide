# Making the installer in Windows (Alternate)

While you don't need a fresh install of macOS to use OpenCore, some users prefer having a full installer.

To start you'll need the following:

* 16GB USB Stick (will vary depending on OS version, 16GB will work fine for latest)
* [gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GibMacOS)
  * This will require [Python 3 installed](https://python.org/releases)
* [macrecovery.py](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
  * This will also require [Python 3 installed](https://python.org/releases)
* [UnPlugged](https://github.com/corpnewt/UnPlugged)
  
## Downloading macOS

Now to start, first open Command Prompt and cd into [gibMacOS's folder](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS), and run one of the following commands:


```sh
# Adjust below command to the correct folder
cd C:/Users/(username)/Downloads/gibMacOS-master/gibMacOS/
```

From here, you'll want to launch gibMacOS.
```sh
python py gibMacOS.py
```

Now, based off of the image below, select the version you want.

# Getting the recovery files

To grab recovery installers is super easy, first grab a copy of [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) and head to `/Utilities/macrecovery/`. Next, click next to the current folder path and type `cmd` to open a Command Prompt in the current directory:

Now run one of the following depending on what version of macOS you want (Note these scripts rely on [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) support, please install if you haven't already):

```sh

```

* **macOS 12 and above note**: As recent macOS versions introduce changes to the USB stack, it is highly advisable that you map your USB ports (with USBToolBox) before installing macOS.
  * <span style="color:red"> CAUTION: </span> With macOS 11.3 and newer, [XhciPortLimit is broken resulting in boot loops](https://github.com/dortania/bugtracker/issues/162).
    * If you've already [mapped your USB ports](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/) and disabled `XhciPortLimit`, you can boot macOS 11.3+ without issues.

This will take some time, however once you're finished you should get either BaseSystem or RecoveryImage files:

![](../images/installer-guide/windows-install-md/macrecovery-done.png)

# Building the full USB

    Format your USB with 2 partitions:

    ◦ A FAT32 partition of ~750MB to 1GB (enough to accommodate the EFI and com.apple.recovery.boot folders)

    ◦ An ExFAT partition of the remaining space (needs to be enough to accommodate the files downloaded from gibMacOS)

    Copy your EFI folder and the com.apple.recovery.boot folder over to the FAT32 partition

    Copy the folder containing the files downloaded from gibMacOS to the ExFAT partition

    ◦ You'll be cding to this folder later - so it may make sense to label it something easy to type like macOS

    Copy UnPlugged.command to that same folder on the ExFAT partition

## Now with all this done, head to [Setting up the EFI](./opencore-efi.md) to finish up your work
